The files in the mh bundle are:

  mhsetup.dtx          mhsetup.ins
  mathtools.dtx        mathtools.ins
  empheq.dtx           empheq.ins
  empheq07.dtx         empheq07.ins

and derived files. The derived files of each .dtx-file are listed
at the top of the respective .dtx-file.


INSTALLATION
============
This follows the usual procedure of .dtx-files. Run LaTeX on each
.ins-file to get the runtime files. These should all be placed in
       TEXMF/tex/latex/mh
on your computer, where TEXMF is your (local) texmf tree.


DESCRIPTION
===========

The mh bundle is a series of packages designed to enhance the
appearance of documents containing a lot of math. The main
backbone is amsmath, so those unfamiliar with this required part
of the LaTeX system will probably not find the packages very
useful.

mathtools v1.01a 2004/10/10
=========

The mathtools package provides many useful tools for mathematical
typesetting. It is based on amsmath and fixes various deficiencies
of amsmath and standard LaTeX. It provides:
  -- Extensible symbols, such as brackets, arrows, harpoons, etc.
  -- Various symbols such as \coloneqq (:=).
  -- Easy creation of new tag forms.
  -- Showing only the referenced equations.
  -- Extensible arrows, harpoons and hookarrows.
  -- Starred versions of the amsmath matrix environments for
     specifying the column alignment.
  -- More building blocks: multlined, cases-like environments, new
     gathered environments.
  -- Math versions of \makebox, \llap, \rlap etc.
  -- Cramped math styles.
  -- and more...

mathtools requires mhsetup.

empheq v2.11a 2004/10/10
======

The empheq package is a visual markup extension designed to
function on top of amsmath. It features:
  -- Boxing multi line math displays while leaving equation
     numbers untouched at the margin. Any kind of box will do.
  -- Making the ntheorem package place end-of-theorem markers
     perfectly.
  -- Placing arbitrary material on either side of math displays.
     This includes delimiters that automatically scale to the
     correct size.

empheq requires mathtools.

empheq07 v0.7d 2004/07/27
========

The obsolete version of the empheq package. It is incompatible
with current empheq (and will continue to be so) and is only
provided to make old documents work.


mhsetup v1.01a 2004/10/10
=======

The mhsetup package defines various programming tools needed by
both empheq and mathtools. In the future, most of these tools will
probably be an integral part of LaTeX3.
