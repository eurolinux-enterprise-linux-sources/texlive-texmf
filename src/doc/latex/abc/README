README (this file)
abc.dtx
abc.ins
abc.pdf

 and of the derived files

abc.sty
example.tex
poll.abc

To install the distribution:

o run "latex abc.ins"
o run "latex -shell-escape example.tex" for a test
o move "abc.sty" to locations where LaTeX will find
  it (the FAQ on CTAN in /help/uktug-FAQ gives more
  information about this magic place

Please note that you need, on your system, the
utilities "abcm2ps" (http://abcplus.sourceforge.net),
either "ps2eps" (which comes with teTeX) or "ps2epsi"
(which comes with Ghostscript), and epstopdf (which
comes with teTeX) if you use pdflatex.

Note also that you must enable "shell escape" on
your TeX system via the command line switch (at least);
see the teTeX documentation.
