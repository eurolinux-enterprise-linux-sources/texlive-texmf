This is version 2.2 of the exam documentclass, a major extension of 
version 2.01.  Version 2.2 is fully backward compatible with version 2.01.

The exam documentclass, together with its documentation file
examdoc.tex, attempts to make it easy for even a LaTeX novice to prepare
exams.  Simple commands are provided to:

1. Create questions, parts of questions, subparts of parts, and subsubparts 
of subparts, all with optional point values.

2. Create a grading table, indexed either by question number (listing each 
question and the total possible points for that question) or by page number 
(listing each page with points and the total possible points for that page).

3. Create headers and footers that are each specified in three parts: One 
part to be left justified, one part to be centered, and one part to be right 
justified.

4. Headers and/or footers can be different on the first page of the exam, 
can be different on the last page of the exam, and can vary depending on 
whether the page number is odd or even, or on whether the current page 
continues a question from a previous page, or on whether the last question 
on the current page continues onto the following page.

5. Multiple line headers and/or footers are allowed, and it's easy to 
increase the part of the page devoted to headers and/or footers to allow 
for this.


The documentation file examdoc.tex attempts to explain all of the 
possibilities in a readable way, with many specific examples.
