              The material to be framed consists of quite a few lines to
              emphasize the fact that virtually anything can go
              inside a \texttt{generalframe}. Note that we are limited
              by \TeX's memory as the material to frame has to be passed
              as an argument. You can't cheat by passing a \texttt{vbox}
              that has already been set (as you might with some other
              macros) since \texttt{generalframe} has to re-set all of it.
