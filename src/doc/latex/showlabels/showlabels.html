<h1>Showlabels</h1>
<div class="abstract">
<p>Put the names of <code>\label</code>s into the margins of a
draft document.</p>
<p>Version 1.6, 2006 May 26.</p>
</div>

<p>This class option introduces no new commands, it just helps you
keep track of all the labels by putting the name of the new label into
the margin whenever either the <code>\label</code> command is used, or
an equation is automatically numbered (by replacing the internal
<code>\@eqnnum</code> command).  There are therefore no usage
instructions.  You invoke this package with the command
<code>\usepackage{showlabels}</code> in the preamble, and you may give
the options <code>[inner]</code> or <code>[outer]</code> (the default)
to have the labels placed in the inner or outer margin of the text.</p>

<p>The package will also work in the presence of the
<code>[twocolumn]</code> option.  In this case, the options
<code>[inner]</code> and <code>[outer]</code> will be ignored, and the
label will be placed in the nearer margin.</p>

<dl>

<dt>1.6, 2006 May 26</dt>
<dd>The <code>\showlabels</code> command will now work with commands
  (such as <code>\cite</code> or <code>\includegraphics</code>) which
  take an optional argument.</dd>

<dt>1.5a, 2005 March 17</dt>
<dd>Defined <code>\showlabelfont</code> using
<code>\ttfamily</code> rather than <code>\tt</code> (I'd
avoided doing this before to avoid a seemingly pointless
incompatibility with LaTeX 2.09, but (a) I imagine the
package is incompatible with that for other reasons, and (b)
it's really not worth the hassle...).</dd>

<dt>1.5, 2004 October 8</dt>
<dd>Added <code>\showlabelfont</code> and
<code>\showlabelsetlabel</code> commands, allowing
customisation of the printed labels.  Added and documented
options [final], [draft] (the former makes this package do
nothing; the latter is the default behaviour).
</dd>

<dt>1.4a, 2003 January 28</dt>
<dd>Acquired the <code>[left]</code> and
<code>[right]</code> options, and fixed a bug which affected
<code>\label</code> commands in captions.</dd>

<dt>1.4, 2001 July 24</dt>
<dd>Became (more) compatible with the
wrapfig package.  Also, I added the
<code>\showlabels</code> command, to have the package display
references to commands other than <code>\label</code>
(<code>\cite</code> and <code>\ref</code> are obvious ones),
and an <code>[inline]</code> option to have labels (etc.)
displayed inline where possible, rather than always in the
margin.</dd>

<dt>1.3e, 2001 May 30</dt>
<dd>Became compatible with the hyperref package in
particular, and in general with other packages which
themselves modify the <code>\label</code> command.  This will
work, however, only if the showlabels package is loaded after
other packages which do this.  Notwithstanding Sebastian
Rahtz's excellent general advice on this, showlabels should
indeed be loaded after hyperref.</dd>

<dt>1.1, 2001?</dt>
<dd>Modified to conform to the slightly
different mechanism that <code>amsmath</code> uses to produce equation
numbers.  I don't habitually use <code>amsmath</code>, so I won't
discover any bugs or weaknesses with its support here, and I'd
consequently be glad to be informed of any that appear.  Do note that
the <code>\usepackage{showlabels}</code> command <em>must</em> appear
after the <code>\usepackage{amsmath}</code> if it is to detect that
you are using the amsmath package.  Note also that, since these
additions appeared, AMS-LaTeX and the <code>amstex</code> package seem
to have been declared `obsolete' in favour of the <code>amsmath</code>
package.  This package now claims conformance with the
<code>amsmath</code> package alone, though it will probably work with
older versions in fact.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Compatibility and problems</h3>

<p>For reasonably obvious reasons, this package will <em>not</em> work at
all well with the multicol package, and for possibly less obvious
reasons, it won't work with the <code>[leqno]</code> option either (at
some point it should be modified to at least recognise and warn of the
conflict in either case).  The package can occasionally place labels
in the wrong margins, near the top of a page -- see the documentation
for a discussion of this.</p>

<h3>Download and installation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the file
<a href="showlabels-1.6.tar.gz" >showlabels-1.6.tar.gz</a>
or
<a href="showlabels-1.6.zip" >showlabels-1.6.zip</a>
and unpack it.</li>

<li>Run LaTeX on the file <code>showlabels.ins</code> -- this will
unpack the style file <code>showlabels.sty</code> amongst other files.
Place this somewhere where TeX can find it. </li>

<li>Run LaTeX on the file <code>showlabels.dtx</code> to obtain the
documentation.</li>
</ol>
