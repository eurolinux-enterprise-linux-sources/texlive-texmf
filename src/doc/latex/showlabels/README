Showlabels: put the names of \labels into the margins of a draft document
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.6

This package helps you keep track of all the labels you define, by
putting the name of new labels into the margin whenever the
\label command is used.

The package allows you to do the same thing for other commands.  The
only one for which this is obviously useful is the \cite command, but
it's easy to do it for others, such as the \ref or \begin commands.


Changes in 1.6, 2006 May 26
---------------------------
The \showlabels command will now work with commands (such as \cite or
\includegraphics) which take an optional argument.

Changes in v1.5a, 18 March 2005
-------------------------------

Changed definition of \showlabelfont to use \ttfamily rather than \tt
(I'd avoided doing so before, to avoid a pointless incompatibility
with LaTeX 2.09, but that seems barely worth the hassle).

Changes in v1.5, 8 October 2004
-------------------------------

Added \showlabelfont and \showlabelsetlabel commands, allowing
customisation of the printed labels.

Added and documented options [final], [draft] (the former makes this
package do nothing; the latter is the default behaviour).

Changes in v1.4a, 28 January 2003
---------------------------------

The [inline] package option now causes equation labels to be put
between lines also.  [left] and [right] options added.

Fixed bug which meant that [nolabel] stopped \label in \caption from
working.  \caption handling now rather more robust.

Changes in v1.4, 24 July 2001
------------------------------

Significant alteration to the mechanism for displaying the labels,
which makes it easy to do the same trick for the \cite command.  It's
also fairly easy to extend this to any other commands which might want
it, through the new \showlabels command, though \ref is the only one
which immediately springs to mind.

Also, the package option [inline] was introduced, giving an
alternative format for displaying the labels.  This route is ripe for
generalisation.

Corrections to the code which places labels in the margin.  This is
manifest in that the package is now (more) compatible with the wrapfig
package.

Changes in v1.3e, 30 May 2001
-----------------------------

Alteration to the way \label is redefined.  Should now be compatible
with packages such as hyperref, which override the \label command
themselves.

Changes in v1.3d, 19 April 2001
-------------------------------

Slight formatting change -- removed question marks when a label is omitted.

Changes in v1.3c, 22 July 1999
------------------------------

Added an \expandafter to an \ifx test.  Was this _really_ broken in
_all_ those previous versions?!?!?

Changes in v1.3b
----------------

No functional changes, but the package's copyright and licence
conditions were clarified.

Changes in v1.3
---------------

After a long delay, here is an updated version of my showlabels
package.  It corrects all the reported bugs which I could reproduce,
namely:

 * The package now formats labels correctly when the \label command
   appears outside either an equation or a \caption (silly of me).

 * A couple of people reported problems in the interaction with the
   amsmath package.  Either these were confined to that package's
   earlier incarnations as AMS-LaTeX or the amstex package, or else
   there's some arcane circumstance I can't reproduce, so I haven't
   found anything to fix on this matter.  Note that the
   \usepackage{showlabels} command must come _after_ the
   \usepackage{amsmath} command.  Bug-sightings here will be warmly
   appreciated.

 * I haven't worried too much about the precise formatting of the
   labels -- this is, after all, supposed to be a draft-only package.

Thanks, for comments and bug reports, to many testers.  See the
documentation for a full list.
