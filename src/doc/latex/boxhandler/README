  The boxhandler package
  ======================

This package provides a powerful, yet simple, interface for managing and
manipulating the captions of boxed objects (e.g., tables and figures).
In addition to providing wide flexibility in the presentation style of
the captions, this package, when used in combination with conditionally
compiled LaTeX source codes, provides the ability to defer or preempt
the presentation of figures, tables, and their associated lists.  

In this way, one can, for example, by changing a single line of source
code in the .tex file, change the output of LaTeX from a technical
report with tables and figures interspersed in the text, to a
journal-manuscript submission, with figures collected at the end of
document, as well as lof and lot deferred or preempted.  

These routines for table and figure deferral may also be employed to
allow all your figure and table definitions to reside in a separate file
and yet still print out in the proper location in the document.

Run `boxhandler.ins' through LaTeX to produce boxhandler.sty 
     from boxhandler.dtx.
Run `boxhandler.dtx' through LaTeX to produce the documentation.
