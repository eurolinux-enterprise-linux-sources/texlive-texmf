    Memoir is a flexible class for typesetting poetry, fiction, 
non-fiction and mathematical works as books, reports, articles or
manuscripts. Documents can use 9pt, 10pt, 11pt, 12pt, 14pt or 17pt 
as the normal font size. Many methods are provided to let you create
your particular design. The class incorporates over 30 of the more
popular packages.

    NOTE: In order to provide fixes for any problems that may arise
between major releases, you may find a file called mempatch.sty
which contains any current fixes for the memoir class. The class
will automatically include this so DO NOT \usepackage{mempatch}.
The Change lists below do not neccessarily note each release of
the patch or addendum files.

   NOTE: Similarly, there may be a file called memmanadd.* which provides
amendments to the current version of the User Manual.

   NOTE: If you are using the hyperref package dated earlier than 2006/11/15, 
use the memhfixc package after the hyperref package, e.g.,
...
\usepackage[...]{hyperref}
\usepackage{memhfixc}
...
Later versions of the hyperref package automatically load the memhfixc package.
