--------------
 Abstract
--------------

This package provides a flexible and complete user interface to page
dimensions. You can specify them by using intuitive parameters to get
your desired page layout. For example, if you want to set margins
(the left, right, top and bottom margins) to 2cm from each edge of
the paper, what you need is just \usepackage[margin=2cm]{geometry}.

--------------
 Installation
--------------

1) latex geometry.ins  (or `make')
     unpacks `geometry.sty' and `geometry.cfg' from geometry.dtx.

2) Edit `geometry.cfg' 
     if you need to set your default options.
     Add \ExecuteOptions{a4paper} in geometry.cfg
     if you are using A4 paper by default.

3) Copy geometry.sty and geometry.cfg
     into a directory searched by LaTeX.
    
4) To clean up files, type `make clean'.
    
--------------
 Documentation
--------------

The package contains the manual `manual.pdf'. So you don't have to
make the manual, but you can remake it. To create the same manual,
type `make manual' then you have `manual.pdf' with PDF of A4-paper
size. To create the full documentation with the code description,
type `make doc' then you have `geometry.dvi' with DVI of us-letter
size. You can edit manual.drv or geometry.drv and pdflatex or latex
it.

--------------
 Test
--------------

Type `make test' and check the results. Or you can use `sample.tex'
for test, but make sure to set a proper paper size in sample.tex.

Before checking these results by printing with your printer,
I would strongly recommend to `latex testpage' and print testpage.dvi
with your printer to see if the printer margins are properly set.
