2002-07-08 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Release 3.2
      * Added known problem: for crop package with its 'center' option and
        'mag' larger than 1000, the result is not the one expected.
      * Bug fix: double-valued marginratio setting like {1:1,1:5} didn't
        work properly. {h|v}marginratio should have been set by \edef
        instead of \def (line:439-440 in geometry.sty). 
        The bug was introduced in v3.1.
        (I'd like to thank Rolf Niepraschk for his pointing out the bug.)
      * Added two test files: gtest15.tex gtest16.tex

2002-07-04 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Release 3.1
      * Bug fix: error in setting geometry dimensions with \widthof of
        calc package. \Gm@defbylen and \Gm@defbycnt are introduced to set
        geometry dimensions.

2002-06-30 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      (Special thanks to Frank Mittelbach for checking codes patiently
       and providing extremely helpful insight and suggestions)
      * Release 3.0
      * Revised geometry.dtx document.

2002-06-28 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Bug fix: multiple landscape/portrait switches malfunctioned.
      * Bug fix: default hmarginratio wasn't reset when twoside is reset.
        The initialization of default margionratios added in \Gm@clean.

2002-06-12 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Improved 'reset': can reset 'paper' given as a geometry option.
      * Bug fix: class default papersize with class option 'landscape'
        didn't work with \geometry command.

2002-06-05 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Added a landscape correction for dvips with 'special' command.
      * Added 'dvipdfm' (same as 'dvips' internally).
      * Changed driver settings ('dvips', 'pdftex', and all that) to exclusive.
      * Bug fix: 'footnotesep' (\skip\footins) couldn't be reset.
      * Bug fix: 'bindingoffset' didn't work with calc package
      * Bug fix: 'showframe' vbox had improper height settings.
      * Bug fix: complex margin settings with calc, e.g. (1in-50pt)*2/3,
        didn't work well. 

2002-05-27 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Added many '\@onlypreamble' commands.
      * The default vscale is changed to 0.7.
      * Added 'compat2' to achieve option compatibility with the old version.

2002-05-24 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * 'pdfoutput=1' is removed because it is unnecessary and rather harmful
        with package 'hyperref'.
      * The default hscale is changed to 0.7.
      * The default hmaginratio '\Geom@Dhratiotwo' (=2:3) is used
        if \@twosidetrue.
      * 'asymmetric' sets \@mparswitchfalse and \@twosidetrue, so that
         one can use 'asymmetric' as an alternative to the 'twoside' option.

2002-05-21 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Added 'nomarginpar' with \marginparwidth and \marginparsep set to 0pt.
      * Added '\geom@checkmp' checking if marginal notes fall off the page.
      * '\geom@process' revised with new internal macros.
      * Bug fixed: odd/evensidemargin calculations totally modified.

2002-05-20 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Changed the default settings (old defaults --> new defaults)
        - scale={0.8,0.9} --> scale=0.8
        - includeheadfoot, ignoremp --> ignoreall
        - marginratio={2:3,1:2} for oneside, marginratio=2:3 for twoside  
          -->  marginratio={1:1,2:3} for oneside, marginratio=2:3 for twoside

2002-05-19 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * 'asymmetric' just sets \@mparswitchfalse. 'asymmetric=false' does
        nothing.
      * '\geom@process' revised.

2002-05-14 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * 'nohead', 'nofoot' and 'noheadfoot' are just shortcut for
         setting the corresponding LaTeX dimensions to zero, so they
         are overwritable by subsequent options.
      * Added 'asymmetric' option with the same layout on every pages.
        'twoside' automatically set 'asymmetric=false', but users can
         set manually 'asymmetric(=true)'.
      * Changed showparam style.
      * Added 'hcentering' and 'vcentering', which set |hmarginratio=1:1|
        and |vmarginratio=1:1| respectively.
      * Bug fixed: incorrect margins when 'twocolumn' and 'includemp'
      * Bug fixed: '(h|v)centering' option was set even when the value is
        false.
      * Bug fixed: \mag and options with true dimension values caused
        overspecification warning about \mag. Now \mag cannot be specified
        more than once as geometry option.
      * Known Problem: 'reset' still leaves the last papername given as
        a geometry option, not the class original papername.
        Set the proper paper name again after 'reset'.

2002-05-13 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Added 'twocolumn' option
      * "verbose" displays the parameter results on the terminal,
        "verbose=false" (default) still puts them into the log.
      * 'heightrounded' calculation no longer needs ifthen package.
      * Bug fixed: 'heightrounded' always adjusted downwards.
      * Bug fixed: it didn't work with calc package. 
        \Geom@setafter command needs \expandafter's
      * Bug fixed: 'pass' and multiple 'reset' didn't work well.

2002-05-10 Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Added 'showframe' option, which shows textarea and page frames,
        and lines for head and foot to check layout in detail.
        Geometry.sty now contains features of showframe.sty. So showframe.sty
        is deleted from the distribution.
      * Bug fixed: {h,v}offset was set wrong values when 'mag', 'truedimen'
        and \geometry{..} macro were used.
      * Bug fixed: execution timing of changing papersize was wrong.
        This bug was introduced in v3.0 beta.
        
2002-05-09  Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Added 'heightrounded' option. If \textheight is not specified,
        this option rounds it to n-times (n: an integer) of \baselineskip plus 
        \topskip, \textheight = n * \baselineskip + \topskip,
        to avoid "underfull vbox" in some cases. Default is false.
        ifthen package included in LaTeX base bundle is required.
      * Added 'lines' option, which enables users to specify \textheight
        by the number of lines included in \textheight auto-calculating
        \textheight = (lines - 1) * \baselineskip + \topskip.
        This option is prior to all the other options determining 'textheight'
        directly (ie. 'textheight', 'height', 'vscale').
      * Bug fixed: \Geom@dset wasn't set by \edef.

2002-04-26  Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * \geom@setafter and \Geom@dset (both internal) makes LaTeX dimension
        setting as a option (headsep, footskip, hoffset, and etc)
        effective at the beginning of \geom@process for 'pass' option.
      * Revised internal codes specifying papersize.
      * Changed the way of displaying options and parameters in 'verbose' mode.
    
2002-04-25  Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Version 3.0 beta
      * Added 'screen' option as a new papersize (papersize={225mm,180mm}).
        To make presentation with PC and video projector, geometry option
        "screen,centering" with 'slide' documentclass must be the best choise.
      * Added 'pass' option, which disables geometry's auto-layout.
      * Added 'ratio' option equivalent to 'marginratio'.
      * Added 'centering', a shortcut for 'marginratio=1:1'.
      * Added 'innermargin' and 'outermargin', aliases for leftmargin
        and rightmargin respectively.

2002-04-22  Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Version 3.0 Candidate alpha, alpha-2 (formly known as 2.4 alpha-1,2)
      * Added `ignorehead', `ignorefoot', `ignoreheadfoot', and
        `ignoreheadfootmp'(ignoreall) options to disregard
        head/foot/marginpars spaces.
      * Added `{h|v}marginratio' options.
        These options specify visible marginal spaces in each direction,
        left(inner):right(outer) for the horizontal ratio, top:bottom
        for the vertical. They should be set in 'a:b' style and each
        value should be a positive integer less than 100 to avoid
        arithmetic overflow. In default, hmarginratio=2:3 (1:2 for
        twoside) and  vmarginratio=1:2. 
      * The 'automatic' centering is no longer default layout,
        so marginratio={2:3,1:2} is used as default.
      * Removed twosideshift option, use bindingoffset instead.
        bindingoffset is set 0pt as default and supports twoside.

2000-06-28  Hideo UMEKI <hideo.umeki@toshiba.co.jp>
      * Release 2.3
      * Added `truedimen', `columnsep' and `footnotesep' options.
