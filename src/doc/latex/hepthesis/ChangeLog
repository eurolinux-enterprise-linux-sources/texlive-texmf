	* Updated date to today, ready for release 1.3.

2006-09-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updated example document to demonstrate the bold math in titles
	and sans-serif titles.

2006-09-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Made frontmatter centered titles have \LARGE size rather than
	\Large.

	* Added \boldmath to the definition of \bfseries so that maths in
	titles etc. will automatically go bold. Thanks to Donald Arsenau
	for supplying this neat trick!

2006-09-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed a bug in the definition of \definethesis (argument #2 was
	never used).

	* Added sftitles option, using the sfheaders package and some
	changes to the hepthesis-specific sectioning commands. Updated
	documentation to reflect this.

2006-06-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updated the documentation to reflect the recent changes.

	* Removed some lingering \thesis-prefixed commands from the
	examples.

	* Aliased \maketitle to \titlepage{} (see below).

	* Changed behaviour of \titlepage slightly: the first argument
	will no longer be presented prefixed with "of" (so you should
	include "of\\ " in the argument if you want the original,
	non-internationalised behaviour). Also, the first argument is now
	optional, so should be wrapped with square brackets rather than
	curly braces. \thesistitlepage has been similarly updated.
	
	* Deprecated \definethesis command: it is now just a thin wrapper
	for \title and \author.

	* Added titling option to use the titling package if
	available. Otherwise, redefine \title and \author to save their
	arguments in \thetitle and \theauthor, as well as in \@title,
	\@author, so that they are available in the document body, in
	particular for building the title page.

2006-06-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Prompted by a request from Claudia Strabel, the table, figure,
	figure* and sidewaysfigure environments now use standard [!htbp]
	placement specifiers.

2006-02-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Ready for version 1.2 release (no changes since 2006-01-26 and
	no reported bugs from beta testing)

2006-01-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added appendices and colophon environments and updated the
	manual and example accordingly.

	* Changed mainmatter environment to a special comment so that it
	doesn't remove the section numbering until the backmatter starts:
	I don't understand what it is about \renewenvironment that was
	doing this.

	* Fixed typo in backmatter definition which made it treat the
	backmatter as mainmatter.

2005-12-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed pdfpagemode=FullScreen option from hyperref. Maybe
	re-introduce this sort of thing via an option.

2005-12-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed typo ("latex" -> "pdflatex") in the documentation of how
	to use a Makefile to ease the PS/PDF conditional compilation
	issues.

	* Moved frontquote text up by 1.5 cm to balance the page a bit
	better. This is still quite A4-specific: maybe this should be
	specified in terms of \textheight?

	* Added dedication page command and added some \cleardoublepage
	and page style commands to the quote page command to ensure that
	it doesn't overlap with the contents pages.

2005-11-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Hacked the example files into much better shape and updated the
	documentation to mention the new features and the pre-defined figure widths.

	* Added the "deprecated" typeout into the thesis-prefixed commands
	and environments.

	* Added a sidewaysfigure environment, which introduces a
	dependency on the rotating package. It's very standard, so I'm not
	bothered. Maybe add an option to disable the rotating dependency later...
	
	* Added the hide{front,back,frontback} options.

2005-09-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Finished off the first version of the documentation. Example
	files could do with some work which I'm too lazy to do right now
	:-)

	* Added the \Chapter, \ChapterRef etc. commands from a personal
	style file.

2005-09-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed \oddsidemargin and \evensidemargin settings to use the
	\@bindextramargin length.
	
	* Added bindnopdf option.
	
	* Started ChangeLog entries. Oops, I should have started a bit
	earlier, eh?
