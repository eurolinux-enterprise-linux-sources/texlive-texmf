otibet --- tibetan package for Omega/Lambda
(c) Norbert Preining 1997

If you have the full distribution, then nothing must be done, if something
is missing (ovp, ovf, ...), typing `make all' is good. This makes all the
ocps, fontfiles, all examples in ps, odvi (omega output), dvi (from odvicopy).

Important: For the generation of the ovp-file otibetan.ovp you need a
scheme interpreter. See `makefont/Makefile' for details.
