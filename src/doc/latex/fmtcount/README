The package fmtcount.sty provides commands 
that display the value of a LaTeX counter in a variety 
of formats (ordinal, text, hexadecimal, decimal, 
octal, binary etc).  This package was originally provided
with the datetime package, but is now distributed separately.

See the documentation for more details.

To extract the code do:

latex fmtcount.ins

This will create the files: fmtcount.sty (the LaTeX package), 
fmtcount.perl (the LaTeX2HTML package)
and fc-*.def (the language definition files used by 
fmtcount.sty). It will also create two sample files:
fc-samp.tex and fc-lang.tex. The first will work with
LaTeX2HTML, the other won't.

Move the .sty and .def files to somewhere LaTeX will find it 
(e.g. texmf/tex/latex/fmtcount/) and remember to update the TeX 
database. 

Copy the fmtcount.perl file to somewhere where LaTeX2HTML will 
find it (e.g. latex2html/styles/).

To extract the documentation do:

latex fmtcount.dtx
makeindex -s gglo.ist -t fmtcount.glg -o fmtcount.gls fmtcount.glo
latex fmtcount.dtx
latex fmtcount.dtx

Place the resulting file (fmtcount.dvi) into the documentation
directory (e.g. texmf/doc/latex/fmtcount/).
