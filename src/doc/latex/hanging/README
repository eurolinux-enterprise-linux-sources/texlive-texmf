    The hanging package facilitates the typesetting of hanging paragraphs.
It also enables typesetting with hanging punctuation; I don't necessarily
recommend this.

Changes in version 1.2
o Option for less aggressive hanging punctuation

Changes in version 1.1
o Should now work with the ltugboat class
o Takes options to exclude punctuations characters from being hung


    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
hanging.ins
hanging.dtx

    The distribution is provided under the terms of the LaTeX
Project Public License (LPPL).

    To install the package:
o run: latex hanging.ins (which will generate hanging.sty)
o run: latex hanging.dtx
o If you want an index then run: makeindex -s gind.ist hanging
o run: latex hanging.dtx
o Print hanging.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 
o Move hanging.sty to a location where LaTeX will find it.
