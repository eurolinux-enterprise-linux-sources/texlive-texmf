Titlesec package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This package allows to change the sectioning titles.  Amongst its many 
features it provides margin titles, different format in left and right 
pages, rules above and below the title, etc.

Titletoc package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For toc entries formatting, providing the possibility of changing
the format in the middle of a document, grouping the entries
in a single paragraph, pretty free-forms entries, partial tocs, etc.
 
The titletoc.sty file is not part of the titlesec package; it's
an independent package, but it's described in titlesec.tex.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
No .ins/.dtx preinstalation is required.  Move the files to a place 
where LaTeX can find them and typeset titlesec.tex.  All of files in 
this directory are necessary for titlesec.sty to work, except the 
manual titlesec.tex (and this 'readme' file). The manual requires
titlesec.sty and titletoc.sty, and hence all the .tss, .def 
and .new files as well.

Files with extension .new (titlesec.new and titletoc.new) 
are patch files, ie, files with bug fixes, which are loaded 
automatically.

Known problems
~~~~~~~~~~
Some language styles (for babel) add the indentation
after a section in a so radical way that titlesec (which uses
the internal LaTeX macros) cannot supress it again.
For example, spanish (by myself) and frenchb.

Changes
~~~~~~~~
2005/05/19. Patch for titletoc (titletoc.new, level 1) to
fix a bug when partial tocs are used with \include'd
files (a partial toc could appear in the wrong context).
