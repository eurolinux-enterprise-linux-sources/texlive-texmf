Create frames for posters, brochures or magazines

The flowfram package is designed to enable you to create
frames in a document such that the contents of the 
document environment flow from one frame to the next in the 
order in which they were defined.  This is useful for creating 
posters or magazines or any other form of document that does not
conform to the standard one or two column layout.

To extract the code do:

latex flowfram.ins

To extract the documented code do:

latex flowfram.dtx
makeindex -s gind.ist flowfram
makeglos.pl flowfram
latex flowfram.dtx
latex flowfram.dtx

(The documentation requires at least version 2.2 of the
glossary package.)
