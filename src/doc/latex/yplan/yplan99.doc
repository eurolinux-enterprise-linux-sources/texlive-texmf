The Yplan99 YearPlanner consists of two files
Yplan99A.tex & Yplan99B.tex which cover 6 months each
as follows:-

Yplan99A.tex  (January to June 1999)
Yplan99B.tex  (July to December 1999)

in CTAN\macros\latex\contrib\other\yplan\

These files will print a vertical-type daily planner
(ie months along the top, days downwards), with each
6-month period fitting onto a single A4 sheet.
They will also fit onto USA standard size paper.
The vertical size can be adjusted by changing \datestrut.
These files are really just large tables, and so you
may wish to extract just the tables and modify them
for your own use.

I was motivated to design this year-planner as my A4
diary did not have good year-planner at the end.

The files run nicely on Latex 2e, and may have to
be adjusted very slightly to run on LaTeX 2.09.
