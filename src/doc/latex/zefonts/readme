    The `zd' fonts by Constantin Kahn (kahn@math.uni-hannover.de)
    are virtual T1 encoded Computer Modern fonts based on (OT1) Computer
    Modern, Times, and Helvetica fonts, intended for simulate `dc'
    fonts. (Waine Sullivan's `dm' fonts are another approach to
    the substitution of `dc' fonts by virtual ones.)

    Because `dc' fonts are now obsolete, I've adapted the Kahn's package to
    `ec' fonts. The resulting virtual fonts are named according to the ec
    fonts names, changing `ec' by `ze' (zerm1000.vf simulates ecrm1000, and
    so on).

    Another virtual T1 encoded Computer Modern fonts are the almost european
    (`am') fonts, by Lars Engebretsen (enge@nada.kth.se). The main difference
    between `am' and `ze' fonts is that almost european fonts only use
    Computer Modern fonts to simulate the European Modern and, then,
    more characters are lost.
