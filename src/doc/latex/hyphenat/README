    The hyphenat package can be used to disable all hyphenation
in a document or in selected text within the document. It also 
enables hyphenation within `words' that contain analphabetic 
characters (e.g., that include underscores), and hyphenation of
text typeset in monospaced (e.g., CM typewriter) fonts.

Changes in version 2.3a
o Fixed a double hyphenation problem with some non-CM fonts.

Changes in version 2.3
o Added \hyp command for hyphenation of compound hyphenated words.

    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
hyphenat.ins
hyphenat.dtx

    The distribution is provided under the terms of the LaTeX
Project Public License (LPPL).

    To install the package:
o run: latex hyphenat.ins (which will generate hyphenat.sty)
o run: latex hyphenat.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist hyphenat)
o run: latex hyphenat.dtx
o Print hyphenat.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 
o Move hyphenat.sty to a location where LaTeX will find it.
