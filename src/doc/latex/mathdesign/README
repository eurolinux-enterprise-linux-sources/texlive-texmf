The Math Design fonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Free mathematical fonts that match with existing text fonts.

By now, three fonts families are available:

* mdput family     corresponds to    Adobe Utopia      text fonts
* mdugm family     corresponds to    URW Garamond      text fonts
* mdbch family     corresponds to    Bitstream Charter text fonts

These text fonts are available on CTAN:

CTAN directory of Adobe Utopia      : fonts/utopia
CTAN directory of URW Garamond      : nonfree/fonts/urw/garamond
CTAN directory of Bitstream Charter : fonts/charter

The fonts provided by the Math Design project are free; you

version.

NOTES ON UPGRADING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you install a new version of the Math Design fonts, be sure to
delete all the pk files that has been automatically created by xdvi or
yap. If you forget to do that, your document could seem ugly if you
read them with xdvi or yap. Anyway, pdf versions and printing will be
fine.

SMALL CAPITALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To obtain small capitals with the charter and utopia version of the
fonts, you must:

1) Obtain the corresponding commercial fonts from your favorite font
   seller. This is the font you'll need :

   Charter : Charter Small Cap         (bchrc8a.pfb) 
             Charter Bold Small Cap    (bchbc8a.pfb)

   Utopia  : Utopia Expert Regular     (putr8x.pfb)
             Utopia Expert Bold        (putb8x.pfb)

   You need the Windows Postscript versions of the fonts. 

2) Rename the preceding font files. I have indicated in
   parenthesis the new name of each file.

3) Put the renamed file somewhere tex will be able to find them.

   $TEXMF/fonts/type1/bitsrea/charter

   or

   $TEXMF/fonts/type1/adobe/utopia
 
   should be fine.

4) Refresh your texmf file database, by running an utility like
   "mktexlsr" or "texconfig rehash".

5) That's it ! Now use the mathdesign package with the option
   "expert". Small caps and oldstyle figure are available with the
   command \textsc{...}.

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A recent TeX distribution (tetex v. >3.0 or miktex v. >2.0) is
strongly recommended: the installation process will be *much*
easier.

The text fonts must be already installed on your system. If these
fonts are free, you can download them from CTAN. If not, you must get
them from the supplier.

What you need precisely are the *.pfb files. Install them on your
texmf tree in the directory

    $TEXMF/fonts/type1/supplier/name

where $TEXMF is the path of your texmf root, supplier is the name of
the supplier of the font (e.g. adobe) and name is the name of
the font (e.g. utopia).

If you use some recent distribution (e.g. MikTeX, tetex, etc.)
the free fonts are probably already installed on your system.


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

0) First, you must choose the texmf tree where you want to install the
   Math Design fonts. This tree is probably some local or personal tree
   (for example: "c:/localtexmf" with miktex v2.3>).

1) Install now the core files, required by all the Math Design
   package. Download the archive mdcore.zip and unzip it in the root
   directory of the texmf tree you have chosen.

2) Download the archive of each family and unzip it in the root
   directory of the texmf tree you have chosen.

3) Now refresh your texmf file database, by running an utility
   like "mktexlsr" or "texconfig rehash".

4) Update the configuration files of your favourite drivers
   (e.g. dvips, xdvi, yap, pdftex, etc.).

   On recent distributions, a script called 'updmap' does all the job
   for you. 
        
   Add the following lines at the end of the file 'updmap.cfg':

       Map mdput.map
       Map mdugm.map
       Map mdbch.map

   and then run 'updmap' from a command line.


ENJOY
~~~~~

To use the package, simply add the following line in the preamble of 
your source file:

\usepackage[supplier-typeface]{mathdesign}

Where supplier-typeface is one the following:

    adobe-utopia 
    urw-garamond
    bitsream-charter

Please read the documentation for more options and commands.


Thank you for using the Math Design fonts and happy TeXing :-)
