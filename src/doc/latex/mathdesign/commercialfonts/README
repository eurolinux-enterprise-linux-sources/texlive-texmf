The Math Design fonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains mathdesign fonts which fits with commercial
text fonts.

The mathdesign fonts themselves are free, but you have to obtain the
corresponding text fonts from your favorite reseller.

By now only one family is available:

* mdfga family     corresponds to    Fontsite Garamond      text fonts

These text fonts are a creation of the Fontsite : http://www.fontsite.com/

The fonts provided by the Math Design project are free; you
can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.

Please read the generic README file of the mathdesign package for
informations on installation, upgrading, etc.


SMALL CAPITALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generic instructions about the installation and usage of small caps
stand also for these fonts.

The commercial fonts you'll need are: 

   FontSite Garamond : FSGaramondSmallCaps-Regular (fgarc8a.pfb)
                       FSGaramondSmallCaps-Bold    (fgarc8a.pfb)         

You need the Windows Postscript versions of the fonts. You must rename
the files: I have indicated between parentheses the new name of each
file.


Thank you for using the Math Design fonts and happy TeXing :-)
