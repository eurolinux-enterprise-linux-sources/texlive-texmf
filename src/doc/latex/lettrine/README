                            Lettrine bundle

This bundle contains a package that I maintain to typeset dropped
capitals in a LaTeXe document.

Run (pdf)latex on lettrine.dtx to get the documentation (lettrine.dvi
or lettrine.pdf), then on lettrine.ins to strip the comments and create
lettrine.sty.

If you wish, you can customize lettrine.cfg according to your needs.

Have a look at one of the PDF files, demo.pdf (in French), or
demo-de.pdf (in German) in the doc directory, to see how 
different layouts for dropped capitals can be achieved.
You can also play with the source files demo.tex or demo-de.tex.
