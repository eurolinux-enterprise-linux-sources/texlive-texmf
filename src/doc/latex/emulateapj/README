This is emulateapj.cls, version August 13, 2006
For the latest version check http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~alexey/emulateapj

2/9/03: MAJOR CHANGE: This is a complete rewrite of emulateapj.  It adds
the use of single-column floats (figures, tables and footnotes) in the
two-column mode.  All standard LaTeX/AASTeX environments such as
{figure}, {table}, {figure*}, {table*} and {deluxetable} (and
{deluxetable*} added here) should work as expected. Enjoy. 


`emulateapj' is a LaTeX2e class to emulate the Astrophysical Journal
(ApJ) page layout. The page length of the resulting document is very
close to that in ApJ when Times fonts are used instead of the LaTeX
default CM fonts (see below).

If a manuscript is prepared for ApJ submission using the standard AAS
(American Astronomical Society) LaTeX macros and the `aastex' style (see
instructions for authors on the ApJ web site), the only thing required
from the user should be to replace \documentclass{aastex} with
\documentclass{emulateapj}, and perhaps resize figures as desired and
replace {deluxetable} with {deluxetable*}
(possible minor problems are described below).

emulateapj requires revtex4.cls. If you don't have it already, it can be
downloaded from http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/ (it's a small package).
Other extrnal packages used are latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable,
epsf. They should already be present in the modern TeX distributions; if
not, download them from www.ctan.org.

To switch to the Times font, use the accompanying file apjfonts.sty (see
the site above):
\usepackage{apjfonts}. Alternatively, e.g., use the standard
\usepackage{mathptmx}, the only difference is in math and Greek symbols.

Release notes (02/09/03):

1) This is a complete rewrite of emulateapj. The package is now
based on revtex instead of aastex + multicol. Some inconsistencies with
aastex may have been missed, so please don't hesitate to report them.

2) The {deluxetable} environment is re-implemented (the problem with the
the aastex's deluxetable is it does not float). There is also a new
environment {deluxetable*} (absent in aastex) to set a floating table
two-column wide. These were not thoroughly tested, so please report any
problems. Known problems:
  (a) \rotate doesn't work (too difficult to implement). Solution:
      - load package lscape  (\usepackage{lscape} in the header)
      - move table at the end of the paper after references
      - \clearpage before the table
      - \LongTables if the table will span more than 1 page (see next item)
      - put the table inside the landscape environment and \clearpage
        at the end: 
        \clearpage
        \LongTables % optionally
        \begin{landscape}
          \begin{deluxetable}
          ....
          \end{deluxetable}
        \clearpage
        \end{landscape}

3) Multi-page tables cannot be set properly inside the main text; you
need to move the table to the end of the paper (after the references) and
issue the command \LongTables before it.

4) By default, deluxetables are typeset with \footnotesize. If you want
to use a different size, use, e.g., \tabletypesize{\normalsize} _outside_
the deluxetable environment. If you need to increase interline spacing
in the tables, use \def\arraystretch{1.XXX} also _outside_ deluxetables.

5) Option `onecolumn' (as in \documentclass[onecolumn]{emulateapj})
sets the whole paper (except the reference section) in one column
as done by the ApJ for papers with long equations.

6) Options `apj' and `apjl' (\documentclass[apj]{emulateapj}) change the
spacing of the references (the default is ApJL wide spacing), and
also the spacing between figures and text (last check with printed
Journal in 4/2005).

7) By default, appendix subsections are not numbered:
            APPENDIX
     Derivation of Equations
If you want them numbered (`A. Derivation of Equations'), use the option
\documentclass[numberedappendix]{emulateapj}
 
It is recommended to use the {appendix} environment instead of the
stand-alone \appendix command. Figure, table, and  equation counter are
reset within the {appendix} to something like A1,A2,B1 etc. Table and
figure counters are restored at the \end{appendix} because sometimes we
want to place figures and tables belonging to the main matter at the end
of the paper.
 
8) By default, the comment in the upper-left corner of the title page and
under the abstract will say "Draft version \today". There are additional
commands \journalinfo{} and \submitted{} (the latter is equivalent to the
aastex \slugcomment{} which also works) to change those comments. Used
alone, \submitted{} will act on both those places.

9) The \title command sets the entire title, including math, in upper
case. If this is undesirable, use \lowercase{} macro, e.g., 
\title{UPPER CASE OK HERE \lowercase{$a+b=c$}}.

10) On the last page where the references start, there may be problems
with placement of footnotes. There is a command \lastpagefootnotes which
can be issued somewhere before those footnotes. It will result in the
remaining footnotes set together at the end of the text, properly
adjusted.

11) There may be problems with single-column figure placements on the
last page; try moving the figure around or explicitly specifying the [t]
placement.  There may also be minor column misalignments on
complicated pages with footnotes, sections, etc.; these are too difficult
to fix.

12) Any footnotes in the paper title should be set as
\title{Title\footnotemark[1]} \footnotetext[1]{text} (with foootnotetext
outside the title), rather that simply a \footnote{}. 

NOTE that if you use the footnote in the title, the footnote counter for
the main text will be wrong. You need to reset it manually _after_ the
first \section. For example, if the frontmatter footnotes (title +
affiliations) stop at 3, you need \setcounter{footnote}{3}

13) \label's within the deluxetable environments should go INSIDE the
\tablecaption{...} command or after \tablehead

14) ... if, however, you use \tablenum [not recommended], \label should
    go IMMEDIATELY AFTER the \tablenum command

15) Marc Audard reports that if the bibliography is exactly finishing the
page, and the next page should be a table, latex is not working. If an
empty character (\mbox{~}) is added after (or before) the bibliography,
i.e., starting a new page, the problem disappears.

Change Log

2/14/3: fixed several bugs in deluxetable and footnotes inside the title.

3/3/3:  Table caption is made in two lines. works only in {table} or
{table*}, but not in {deluxetable}

3/3/3:  Redefine p@subsection etc. for ApJ-style cross-references.

3/16/3:  Define \tablerefs

3/25/3:  Fix two-column references in the onecolumn mode (see 
         \set@column@hsize{2})

4/9/3:  Change the definition of \tablenotemark. It is less general but
        works in the table caption. Also, put the body of deluxetable*
        inside a minipage to fix table footnotes.

5/14/3: Change section title font sizes. They are now different for 'apj'
        and 'apjl' options

7/8/3:  redefine NAT@sort@cites after loding revtex4 to prevent citations
        from being sorted

7/15/3: Fix \and in the author list

7/17/3: Make \colhead to center column titles by default

7/27/3: Redefile \@biblabel to remove the numbered list from thebibliography

9/08/3: Further fixes to cutinhead: define @ptabularcr and use LT@cols

10/08/3: Copy definitions for \anchor and \url from aastex.

10/10/3: define \paragraph, \subparagraph. suppress section numbering
         below \subsection. If you want subsubsections numbered, use 
         \setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
         in the header

11/13/3: add 'unsortedaddress' option to revtex4 to prevent groupin the
authors by the institute

11/26/3: define \def\blankaffiliation{~} after revtex4 to prevent \and's
         from combining

2/10/4: implement \tablewidth; works as documented in aastex;
        change format for caption of deluxetables from Table 1. Title to
                         Table 1.
                          Title
        Make table notes of the same width as the table.
        Fix tabletypesize for table notes

2/12/4: fix \tablewidth: \tablewidth{0pt} gives natural size (as does no
        \tablewidth at all)
        Remove dot after "Table 1."
        Also change format to Table 1--- Continued

2/19/4: implement \tablenum within deluxetable; abstract paragraphs
        indented; 

3/19/4: if no \tablehead is given, \startdata still prints out the caption

4/2/4: remove a spurious space from the definition of \tablehead

4/12/4: Due to popular demand, define \tablecomments and \tablerefs for
        ordinary {table}s.

6/6/4: Proper implementation of \sidehead in the deluxetable

6/21/4: Fix issues with table heading which were introduced when I tried
        to implement deluxetable's _without_ any heading.

6/22/4: correct implementation of \tablenotetext in the \LongTable mode
        (they previously generated plain footnotes at the end of the table)

9/21/4: fix bug fix figure and table numbers in the appendicies

10/8/4: add \object \facility \dataset from aastex

11/26/4: Change floats-to-text distance to 5mm in ApJLetter style and
         7mm in ApJ style (verified with Journal version in Dec 2004)
 
4/21/5: change \renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.85}; add
        \renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{0.85}
        \setcounter{topnumber}{9}
        \setcounter{bottomnumber}{9}
        \setcounter{totalnumber}{20}
        \setcounter{dbltopnumber}{9} 

11/27/5: Add parameters to fine-tune spacing to deluxetables:
        \abovedeluxetableskip   % = 0 by default
        \belowdeluxetableskip   % = 0 

        Use these to fiddle with the spacing, e.g.
        \setlength{\abovetableskipamount}{-1\baselineskip}

12/14/5: no more explicit setting of tabcolsep inside deluxetables (so
         the user has control over this parameter)


08/13/6: Collect altaffiltext into token and issue \altaffiliation
          only once. This overcomes the problem with 2**n processing 
          time for long affiliation lists.
