\section{The page structure in \LaTeX}

This appendix describes how the actual page is build from it's 
components and how they are influenced by \TeX s parameters 
(\seealso{Fig.\,\ref{bild}}.  Figure~\ref{bild} has been created by 
Nelson Beebe at the University of Utah.

\begin{description}

\item[text area]
	The normal text area (``Body'') contains the running text 
	including footnotes, tables and figures.  The headings, footer 
	and margin notes do \emph{not} belong to the text area.
        
	The text area has the width \texttt{\textbackslash textwidth} 
	and the height \texttt{\textbackslash text\-height}.
        
	In a twocolumn layout the text area is split into two 
	columns, with the width \texttt{\textbackslash columnwidth} 
	each and a space of \texttt{\textbackslash columnsep} between 
	them.  Thus the \texttt{\textbackslash columnwidth} is a 
	little bit smaller than half the \texttt{\textbackslash 
	textwidth}.
	
	\texttt{\textbackslash textwidth} and \texttt{\textbackslash 
	columnwidth} should be a multiple of the width of one 
	character in the \texttt{tt} font.
	
        \texttt{\textbackslash textheight} should be multiple of the 
        line height \texttt{\textbackslash baselineskip}, increased by 
        the constant value of \texttt{\textbackslash topskip}.
	
	Indentations inside the text area are defined with 
	\texttt{\textbackslash leftskip} and \texttt{\textbackslash 
	rightskip}.  These parameters should not be changed explicit 
	by the user but rather implicit through environments.
	
\item[left margin]
	The left margin is either \texttt{\textbackslash odd-} or 
	\texttt{\textbackslash evensidemargin} increased by 1~inch.  
	Both parameters have the same value, unless the 
	\texttt{twoside} option is given.

\item[top margin]
	The top margin is the sum of \texttt{\textbackslash 
	topmargin}, \texttt{\textbackslash headheight} and 
	\texttt{\textbackslash headsep} increased by 1~inch.

\item[right margin]
	The right margin is the paper width minus the left margin and 
	the text area.

\item[bottom margin]
	The bottom margin is the paper height minus the top margin and 
	the text area.
       
\item[heading]\index{headings}
	The heading is inside the top margin with a space of 
	\texttt{\textbackslash headsep} between the lower border of 
	the header and the upper border of the text area.  Above the 
	header is a free space of \texttt{\textbackslash topmargin} 
	increased by 1~inch.
      
\item[footing]\index{footings}
	The footer is inside the bottom margin with a space of 
	\texttt{\textbackslash footskip} between the lower border of the text 
	area and the lower border of the footer.
	
\item[margin notes]\index{margin notes}
	Margin notes are inside the left or right margin.  They have a 
	width of \texttt{\textbackslash marginparwidth} and a space of 
	\texttt{\textbackslash marginparsep} between the margin note 
	and the text area.  The vertical space between two margin 
	notes is \texttt{\textbackslash marginparpush}.
		    
\end{description}

The paperheight consists of the following elements (from top to 
bottom):
\begin{verse}
\rmfamily 1 Inch \\*[2pt]
\ttfamily \textbackslash topmargin \\*[2pt]
\textbackslash headheight \\*[2pt]
\textbackslash headsep \\*[2pt]
\textbackslash textheight \\*[2pt]
\textbackslash footskip \\*[2pt]
\rmfamily remaining page.
\end{verse}

On pages with margin notes in the right margin the paperwidth consists 
of the following elements:
\begin{verse}
\rmfamily 1 Inch \\*[2pt]
\ttfamily \textbackslash oddsidemargin
\rmfamily\ \ or\ \ 
\ttfamily \textbackslash evensidemargin \\*[2pt]
\textbackslash textwidth \\*[2pt]
\textbackslash marginparsep \\*[2pt]
\textbackslash marginparwidth \\*[2pt]
\rm remaining page
\end{verse}
With the option \texttt{twoside} the left pages change to
\begin{verse}
\rmfamily 1 Inch \\*[2pt]
\ttfamily \textbackslash evensidemargin \\*[2pt]
\textbackslash textwidth \\*[2pt]
\rmfamily remaining page
\end{verse}

\marginlabel{Comments:} The parameters \texttt{\textbackslash 
topmargin}, \texttt{\textbackslash oddsidemargin} and 
\texttt{\textbackslash evensidemargin} may be negative.  In this case 
the margin will be smaller than 1~inch.  The same is true for 
\texttt{\textbackslash leftskip} and \texttt{\textbackslash 
rightskip} which leads to text that is wider than the text area.

Extensive treatment and figures to this subject may be found in the
\textsc{TUGboat} Vol.9, No.1 (April 1988).

The parameter \texttt{\textbackslash footheight} is no longer defined 
in \LaTeXe\ since no-one used it.

\section{Description of the refman-class family}
\label{refman}

The \texttt{refman.sty} was defined at the EDV-Zentrum (computing 
center) of the TU Wien. This layout is suitable for reference 
manuals, technical descriptions and similar applications. It is based 
on the ideas shown in previous sections: The layout has a wide left 
margin for headings and margin notes and smaller margins on the right 
side, the top and the bottom.

In 1994 this layout was re-implemented as a class for the new \LaTeXe. 
This made it possible to include some minor improvements, like the 
support of different paper sizes. The \texttt{refman.sty} was split 
into two classes
\texttt{refrep}\index{refrep.cls} similar to \texttt{report} and 
\texttt{refart}\index{refart.cls} similar to \texttt{article}.
These classes differ in the layout of the header and footer. The 
\texttt{refart} does not support the \texttt{\textbackslash chapter} 
command.

The current version of this class is described in this document. If 
serves as an example for the layout.


\subsection{Invocation}
\index{refart, invocation}
\index{refrep, invocation}

The \LaTeX\ local guide (if available) shows if this class is available 
at your \TeX\ installation or where to install it.  To use the 
\texttt{refart} class, simply call it with the \verb|\documentclass| 
command:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{refart}
\usepackage{german} % other packages you may want 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Options}
\index{options}

The \texttt{refart} class replaces \texttt{article} and \texttt{refrep} 
replaces \texttt{report}. They support all options of these classes 
except for the \texttt{twocolumn} option.

It supports the additional option \texttt{square} which makes the 
\texttt{\textbackslash textheight} equal to the 
\texttt{\textbackslash textwidth}. 

Neither \texttt{refart} nor \texttt{refrep} support twocolumn 
layout, thus the commands \verb|\twocolumn| and \verb|\onecolumn| 
must not be used.

The index will be set in twocolumn format and you can't change it 
with the means of this class. 

\subsection{Layout changes}

\subsubsection{Page design}

\index{page design, horizontal}\marginlabel{Horizontal:}
In this design the usable area for text (\verb|\fullwidth|) is 
calculated as the paper width minus 2~inch.  Only a fraction of this 
width is used for the running text (\verb|\textwidth|), the remaining 
part forms a wide left margin (\verb|\leftmarginwidth|) which is used 
for headings and margin notes.  The \verb|\textwidth| is 70~\% of the 
\verb|\fullwidth| by default, but this can be changed with the 
\verb|\settextfraction| command\index{settextfraction} which accepts 
arguments between 0 and 1.


\index{page design, vertical}\marginlabel{Vertical:}
The text height is calculated as the paper height minus 2~inch. This 
leaves a top margin of 1~inch, which is modified by some pagestyles 
(see \ref{pagestyle}).

The pages are always set with a ragged bottom.

\subsubsection{Section headings}

The headings for \verb|\section|, \verb|\subsection| and 
\verb|\subsubsection| extend into the left margin, thus using the full 
width of the page.  They are not justified and hyphenation is 
discouraged.  A small space is kept free above and below the heading.  
Headings for \verb|\section| and \verb|\subsection| are set in a bold 
font.

The \texttt{refrep} class defines a different layout for the  
\verb|\chapter| command: It always starts a new page and prints the 
chapter headings in a large bold font with a thick line above and 
below. This heading uses the full width of the page.

A similar heading is created by the \verb|\part| commands which is 
available in both classes. It uses a roman part number instead of the 
arabic section number.

The \verb|\maketitle| commands sets the title of the document in the 
same layout when no special titlepage is requested.  (This is the 
default for \texttt{refart}.  To suppress the titlepage in a 
\texttt{refrep} document, you can use the \texttt{notitlepage} option.) 
The name of the author and the date is printed in italic flush right 
below the document title.

\subsubsection{Paragraphs}

Paragraphs are separated by a vertikal space (\verb|\parskip|) of 
half a line (\verb|0.5\baselineskip|) plus a strechtable length of 2pt.
Paragraphs are not indented.

The vertical spacing inside, above and below a list environment is the 
same as in the running text.

\subsection{Footnotes}\index{footnote}

The footnote layout consists of a small margin (1em) which contains 
the footnote symbol. A small space is set between the symbol and the 
footnote text. The paragraphs of the footnote are not indented. There 
is currently no space between two footnotes, I'm not sure it this will 
stay this way. The footnote symbol is set as a superscript. This may 
change in later versions. I'm relying on user feedback to finally 
solve this.

\subsubsection{Description environment}
\index{description environment}

The \texttt{description} environment will use the whole left margin 
for the description label. 

\seealso{\ref{layout}}
You will find examples in the section~\ref{layout}.

\subsubsection{Positioning of margin notes}

Margin notes (\verb|\marginpar|) are always put into the left margin. 
They use the whole width of the margin.

The minimum space between two margin notes is set to 0 to prevent 
them from being shifted around when many margin notes are used.

\subsubsection{Headers and Footers} \label{pagestyle}
\index{pagestyle}

The pagestyle \texttt{plain} puts the page number into the footer in 
the right corner. When the option \texttt{twoside} is active, the page 
number of left pages is put into the left corner.

\index{headings}
\index{myheadings}
The pagestyles \texttt{headings} and \texttt{myheadings} create a 
header which spans the whole width of the page. The headings contain 
the running head (\verb|\section| and \verb|\subsection| in 
\texttt{refart} and \verb|\chapter| and \verb|\section| in 
\texttt{refrep}) when \texttt{headings} is used or a fixed text that can 
defined  with the \texttt{\textbackslash markboth} command when 
\texttt{myheadings} is used. The heading will be set in a slanted 
font and separated from the body by a thin line.

\index{footings}
\index{myfootings}
In addition to the standard classes, \texttt{refman} supports a style 
for footers, which is used in this documentation. The information is 
exactly the same as in the headings but now printed in the footer with 
a thin line above.

To use a userdefined string you can say:
\begin{verbatim}
\pagestyle{myfootings} % or myheadings
\markboth{left title}{right title}
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{heading} and \texttt{myheading} commands increase the top 
margin by one line while the \texttt{footings} and 
\texttt{myfootings} commands decrease the top margin by one line.
The pagestyles \texttt{empty} and \texttt{plain} leave the top margin 
unchanged. You should not combine headings and footings in one document.

\subsection{Additional commands}

\subsubsection{Marginlabel}
\index{marginlabel}

The command \verb|\marginlabel{xxx}| prints the text \texttt{xxx} right 
justified into the left margin. Please note that a 
\texttt{\textbackslash marginpar} will print it left justified.


\marginlabel{Example:} The word ``Example'' in the left margin is 
printed with the command \verb|\marginlabel{Example:}|

\subsubsection{Attention}
\index{attention}\index{attentionsymbol}\index{manfnt}

The command \cs{attention} puts an exclamation mark with an arrow 
pointing to the text into the left margin.\attention This is an 
example for \cs{attention}.

\renewcommand{\attentionsymbol}{\texttt{:-)}}
\attention
Since version 2.0c you can change the symbol used for the 
\cs{attention} command using a 
\verb|\renewcommand{\attentionsymbol}{\texttt\{:-)\}}|
command. To get the default back use
\verb|\renewcommand{\attentionsymbol}| \verb|{\large \bfseries ! $\rightarrow$}|
\renewcommand{\attentionsymbol}{\large \bfseries ! $\rightarrow$}

Since version 2.0c \cs{attention} takes an optional argument to 
define the symbol used in the margin. Thus you can change the symbol 
once without having to restore it later. Do not abuse this 
feature\attention[\texttt{:-(}], it is primarily meant as an support 
for the manfnt package to substitute the ``dangerous bend'' by a 
``double dangerous bend''.

If you have the manfnt-font available you can use the enclosed 
\texttt{manfnt} package. It gives you easy 
access to the symbols defined in this font.

\subsubsection{Seealso}
\index{seealso}

The command \verb|\seealso{n}| prints an arrow and its argument into 
the left margin. You will find examples for this in the left margin 
and in \seealso{1} chapter~1.

\subsubsection{Maxipage environment}
\index{maxipage}

The \texttt{maxipage} environment is a special kind of 
\texttt{minipage} which extends over the full width of the page. It 
can be used for long formulas or \texttt{tabular} environments. You may 
use \texttt{maxipage} environments inside floats. You cannot use 
margin notes inside a \texttt{maxipage} and no pagebreak will occur 
while in a \texttt{maxipage}. A \texttt{maxipage} is always a 
paragraph of its own with a thick line above and below. You can 
disable these lines with the \texttt{\textbackslash 
maxipagerulefalse}\index{maxipagerule}
command. They are on by default.

The following paragraph is an example for a \texttt{maxipage}:
\nopagebreak
\begin{maxipage}
This very long line is an example for a \texttt{maxipage}. It extends 
over the full width of the page, including the left margin.
\end{maxipage}\nopagebreak
This is normal text after the \texttt{maxipage}.

\subsubsection{Fullpage environment} \label{fullpage}
\index{fullpage}

The \texttt{fullpage} environment consists of one ore more pages where 
the text extends over the full width of the page. You cannot use 
margin notes inside a \texttt{fullpage} environment. A \texttt{fullpage} 
will always start and end on a page of its own. It may be used for 
large tables, program listings or anything that does not fit into the 
normal layout.

\seealso{See page \pageref{bild}}
Page~\pageref{bild} is an example for a \texttt{fullpage}.

\subsubsection{Noparskip}

The \verb|\noparskip| removes the vertical space between two 
paragraphs. It is similar to the \verb|\noindent| command that removes 
the indent of the first line of a paragraph.

\subsubsection{Setleftmarginwidth}
\index{setleftmarginwidth}

The \verb|\setleftmarginwidth| command is no longer supported. You can 
achieve similar results by using the \verb|\settextfraction| command.

\subsubsection{Descriptioncolon}
\index{descriptioncolon}

By default a colon is printed after the description label.
The command \texttt{\textbackslash description\-colonfalse}  disables 
the colon, the \texttt{\textbackslash description\-colontrue} 
re-enables ist.

\subsubsection{Descriptionleft}
\index{descriptionleft}

The \verb|\descriptionlefttrue| command sets the description label 
left justified into the margin. The default is right justified which 
will be achieved with \verb|\descriptionleftfalse|

\subsubsection{Maxipagerule}
\index{maxipagerule}

You can disable the rules before and after a \texttt{maxipage} with 
the \texttt{\textbackslash maxipage\-rulefalse} command and re-enable 
them with the \texttt{\textbackslash maxipageruletrue} command.  The 
default is on.  You should not mix \texttt{maxipage}s with and without 
rules in one document.

\subsubsection{Condbreak}
\index{condbreak}

The command \verb|\condbreak{2cm}| ensures, that the next 2~cm are 
either completely on this page or completely on the next. No 
pagebreak will appear in the next 2~cm.

This is really a hack to achieve what the \texttt{\textbackslash 
samepage} command often fails to do.

\subsubsection{Example}
\index{example}

The \texttt{example} environment acts like a \texttt{verse} 
environment but uses a \texttt{tt} font.  

\subsubsection{Pageperchapter}
\index{pageperchapter}

The command \verb|\pageperchapter| creates page number that start with 
1 for every new chapter. This may be useful for larger manuals. Since 
it works with chapters it is only available in the 
\texttt{refrep} class.
