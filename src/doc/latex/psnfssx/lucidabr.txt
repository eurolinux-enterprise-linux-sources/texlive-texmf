              LaTeX Support for Lucida Bright
============================================================
Copyright 1997--2003 David Carlisle, Sebastian Rahtz and

The macro packages
==================
The macro packages lucidabr.sty and lucbmath.sty support
using the Lucida Bright and Lucida New Math fonts with
LaTeX.  Loading the package lucidabr changes all text and
math fonts to Lucida:

  \usepackage[...]{lucidabr}

Loading the package lucbmath changes only the math fonts, so
that you can use the Lucida New Math fonts together with
font families, which have no math fonts of their own.  The
default roman font family (i.e.  \rmdefault) must be changed
_before_ loading of the package:

  \renewcommand{\rmdefault{...}
  \usepackage[...]{lucbmath}


Using AMS LaTeX
===============
When using the Lucida New Math fonts with the amsmath
package, the sequence of loading is crucial.  The lucidabr
or lucbmath packages are to be loaded _after_ amsmath only:

  \usepackage{amsmath}
  \usepackage{lucidabr} % or lucbmath

Otherwise certain math symbols will be broken.


Package options
===============
Package Options in version 4.4 (new options in release 4.x
marked with *):

  expert
  noexpert         (default)
          Declares whether the extended `expert' set is available.
          Mainly the expert set provides bold math fonts.

  nolucidascale
  lucidascale       (default)
  lucidasmallscale
          Controls the relative sizes of the text and math fonts used.

* mathitalic1       (default)
* mathitalic2
* mathitalic3
   Controls the style of the `math italic letters' Style 1
   uses the `Lucida Math Italic Alternate' font.  Style 2
   uses the `Lucida Math Italic' font.  Style 3 uses the
   `Lucida Math Upright Italic' font.  Style 1 is the
   default.  Style 3 is only available with the expert set.

* slantedgreek      (default)
* uprightgreek
   Controls whether lowercase greek is slanted or upright.
   Uppercase Greek is always upright.  These options match
   those of the mathtime package.

* vargreek
   Define extra command names to access:  uppercase slanted
   Greek (\varGamma...)  lowercase upright Greek
   (\upalpha...)  Irrespective of whether \alpha is
   accessing upright or slanted Greek alphabet.

* OT1
* T1
* LY1
   Controls the encoding used in the operators font.
   Normally these options do not need to be explicitly given
   as the default is to use the current default text
   encoding, so if \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} is used before
   loading this package, T1 encoding will be used.  These
   options are similar to the ones provided by the mathtime
   package.  Note that when cm fonts are being used the OT1
   encoding is always used for the operators font as it is
   required to access Greek in that case.  However Lucida
   provides upper and lowercase Greek in the math fonts.

* seriftt
   The default Lucida monospace font is sans serif.  If the
   expert set is available this option enables the use of a
   seriffed monospace font as the family used by \ttfamily
   and \textttt.

* fax
   Use the `fax' variant of Lucida Bright as the Roman
   family.  This is available in all four combinations of
   bold and italic.

* casual
   Use the `casual' variant of Lucida Bright as the Roman
   family.  This requires the expert set.  No bold is
   available for this set.

* calligraphic
   Replace the italic font in whichever Roman family is
   being used by Lucida calligraphic italic, for a more
   flamboyant style.

* handwriting
   Replace the italic font in whichever Roman family is
   being used by Lucida Handwriting italic.  You probably
   don't want to do this in technical documents that make
   use of the Lucida New Math fonts, but it is there if you
   need it.

* noamssymbols
   Do not define individual command names to all the AMS
   math symbols (and a few extra Lucida math symbols).  This
   makes this package emulate the amsfonts package rather
   than the amssymbl package.  It saves a lot of space for
   smaller TeX systems.  You can then just define commands
   for the symbols you are going to use.
         
* errorshow         (default)
* warningshow
* nofontinfo
   This package makes a lot of font re-assignments.  The
   default warning messages can get rather obtrusive.  These
   option names match those in the mathtime package.  The
   default behaviour for this package is `errorshow' that
   is, only font errors are shown to the terminal.  The
   warningshow option re-instates the normal LaTeX
   behaviour, font warnings go to the terminal and the log.
   The `nofontinfo' option stops the font tracing
   information altogether, it is not written even to the
   log.

* altbullet
   The bullet in the Lucida Bright text font is relatively
   small.  Using this option you get instead the larger
   bullet from the math symbol font.


NFSS classification of the text fonts and usage notes
=====================================================
NB:  
The information in this section does _not_ apply, if you are
using the fonts that come with StarOffice (as opposed to
Y&Y's originals.)

Available font encodings are T1, TS1 (text companion) and 
LY1 (Y&Y proprietary).  

The obsolete OT1 font encoding, while still being the
default with LaTeX, is _not_ supported.  Thus, you should
switch to T1/TS1 or LY1 before using the Lucida Bright
fonts, for instance:

  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage{textcomp}
  \usepackage{lucidabr}
  ...

Many, but not all of the Lucida fonts provide an Euro
symbol \texteuro in the LY1 and TS1 encoding.  Families or
shapes that are lacking the Euro are marked in the above
table with an asterisk.  

The Lucida fonts do not include all symbols of the TS1
(text companion) font encoding:  Only those symbols are
available, that belong to the ISO-Adobe 1 character set,
plus the Omega and (partially) the Euro.

All demibold fonts are assigned to series `b'.  The two
sans serif bold fonts are assigned to `ub' (ultra bold).
This means that with the exception of the Sans bold fonts
_all_ fonts in the Lucida Bright font set are available
through normal `user level' commands such as \bfseries,
\sffamily etc.  To access the bold Sans Serif one may go
\fontseries{ub}\sffamily.

The blackletter font is made available in math mode as
\mathfrak (with the lucidabr or lucbmath package).  If you
want to use this as a text font, you should define a command
to execute \fontfamily{hlcf}\selectfont.  Unfortunately, the
available encodings do _not_ provide the "long s", but
LucidaBlackletter was not made to mimick historical
typesetting, anyway.
