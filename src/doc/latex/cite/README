This directory contains four .sty files that are mutually compatible,
but actually independent:

cite.sty       Compressed, sorted lists of numerical citations: [8,11-16]

overcite.sty   Compressed, sorted lists of superscript numerical citations:
               "word [12,16,11,13,14,15]."  -->  "word.$^{11-16}$"

drftcite.sty   Print the tags instead of the numbers for \cite and \bibitem.

chapterbib.sty Do multiple bibliographies--one for each \include file.

Each package works with LaTeX2e and LaTeX2.09.  (These versions are the
last that will support 2.09!)  The documentation is included as plain
text after the definitions in each file (below \endinput).  It can be
read online or printed directly, but don't try to typeset it with LaTeX!

Since the instructions follow \endinput, they are not read by TeX and
should not slow down the file loading.  If, however, you see that the
instructions slow down the loading on your system, you may split the
file into, for example, cite.sty and cite.doc.  Just do not redistribute
these split files.
