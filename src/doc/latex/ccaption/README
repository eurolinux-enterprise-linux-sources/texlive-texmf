    The ccaption package provides commands for `continuation captions',
unnumbered captions, and a legend heading for any environment. 
Methods are provided to define captions for use outside float 
environments, and to define new float environments and subfloats. 
Tools are provided for defining your own captioning styles.

    The packagehas been tested in conjunction with the rotating, caption2, 
subfigure, sidecap, endfloat, longtable, xtab, tocloft and hyperref packages.
