The Société mathématique de France provides 
a set of classes, packages and bibtex styles
that are used in its publications.
They are based on Ams classes (whose code is sometimes recopied)
and mainly "upward-compatible".

Their main features are
   1. quite different design
   2. new environments for typesetting some informations
in two languages (altabstract, alttitle, altkeywords)
   3. if necessary, use of babel (option frenchb) and desactivation
of some features of frenchb.

The following files are included.

  smfart.cls
  smfbook.cls   classes for articles and books

  smfenum.sty   package for new alignment style of enumerations
  smfthm.sty    package for simplified definition of theorems

  smfplain.bst
  smfalpha.bst  BibTeX styles 

  e-doc.tex     documentation and advices (in english)
  f-doc.tex     documentation et conseils (in french)
