	OXFORD STYLE PACKAGE
	
This is the oxford bst style package, version 0.4. It is a bibtex style geared
at citations for the humanities.

	STYLE
The oxford style implements the oxford style interpreted through the eye of
a swede working in the fields of the history of ideas. 

The style is based on Harvard.sty and a heavily hacked bst-file generated with
custom-bib. It currently only supports

\cite[]{}

and

\cite{}

and only in abrevation mode.

The form of the bibitem entries is
\harvarditem[Jones, STITLE]{Jones, TITLE .... (PUBLISH:ADRESS, YEAR)}{1990}{key}
	Brian Jones, TITLE ... (PUBLISH:ADRESS, YEAR).

The style gives the full reference att the first citation and then an
abrevated one.

The file suports an additional entry in the bib-file, stitle (short title). It
is used in the abrevated citation.

The abrevated citation follows these rules:

If (lastname == UNIQ) {
	lastname
} elsif (stitle == EXIST) {
	lastname, stitle
} else {
	lastname, title
}
 
oxford.sty also inserts an "ibid." if the current citation is the same
as the last one.


	USAGE

\usepackage[default, none]{oxford}
.
.
.
\bibliographystyle{oxford_xx}

where xx stands for chosen language


	INSTALL

In the distibution there are only two languages directly supported:
swedish
english

You install the oxford package either by putting the files in places you alreday
know are supported by latex, eg.:

cp oxford.sty /usr/lib/texfm/texfm/tex/latex/base
cp oxford_se.bst /usr/lib/texfm/texfm/bibtex/bst/base
cp oxford_en.bst /usr/lib/texfm/texfm/bibtex/bst/base

Or you shose another location and then has to set som environmental variables,
eg.:

The place you put oxford.sty have to be exported with TEXINPUTS:
export TEXINPUTS=/usr/lib/texmf/texmf/tex/latex/local:

The place where you put the bst-files have to be exported with BSTINPUTS:

BSTINPUTS=/usr/lib/texmf/texmf/bibtex/bst/oxford:

(Don´t forget the trailing colon (:)

	LANGUAGE

The oxford_in.bst has support for any kind of languages. But you have to create
a language version of oxford_in.bst yourself. In the directory "lang" there are
translations for english, finnish, german, norsk, svenska,
esperant, french, italian and spanish.

All you have to do is open "oxford_in.bst" and substitute all bbl.CODE and MACRO
entries with the right translations (which can be found in the mbs-files) and 
name the file oxford_LANG.bst
