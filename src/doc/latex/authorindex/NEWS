November 2006:

- Include an enhancement by Pieter Eendebak for natbib.cfg (part
  of the documentation)

March 2005:

- Support for authauthor and autheditor fields in BibTeX data base.
  These fields serve to provide a consistent spelling of author names

- Bugfix: When using multiple BibTeX data bases, they will be queried
  in the sequence given in the LaTeX source.  This is important when
  some data bases define @STRINGs used in others.

October 2004:

- Bugfix: Gracefully handle spaces in citation commands with multiple
  arguments.  Previous versions included the space in the key, which
  cased the search in the BibTeX data base to fail.
