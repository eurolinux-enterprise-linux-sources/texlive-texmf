Installation Instructions:
Create a directory in the search path of your LaTeX installation called
acrotex, and unzip the acrotex.zip package.  Install the AcroTeX
Bundle by executing the command: latex acrotex.ins. The eq2db Package (optional)
can be installed with the command: latex eq2db.ins.

Now try LaTeXing the file webeqtst.tex, with the appropriate driver
option set: E.g.,
\usepackage[dvipsone]{web}
\usepackage[dvips]{web}
\usepackage[pdftex]{web}
\usepackage[dvipdfm]{web}

Hopefully everything will work correctly.

The manual of usage, webeqman.pdf, was written using the web and
exerquiz packages.  The printable version, webeqman_p.pdf is the
manual re-LaTeXed using the `forpaper' option of the exerquiz
package.  All the details are contained in this manual.

If you want to do something fancy with eForms, review the eformman.pdf.
If you are interested in online quizzing, see eq2dbman.pdf.

I maintain a web site featuring TeX/LaTeX/PDF stuff called
AcroTeX (www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/acrotex.html).  There you
will find the home web page of the AcroTeX eDucation Bundle.
(www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/webeq.html).

Now, I simply must get back to work.
