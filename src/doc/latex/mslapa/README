This directory contains my version of LaTeX and BibTeX style files for a
respectably close approximation to APA (American Psychological Association)
citation and reference style.  This version is based on things found in the
attempts of others at an APA-like style (including the files apalike, newapa,
and apabst).  However, I have added several features beyond those to be found
in the previous styles.  I also include an example file to show how the style
is used.  To run off the example, on UNIX you would type something like:

	latex examp ; bibtex examp ; latex examp ; latex examp ; dvips examp

To install this style, you should move `mslapa.bst' to the place your
installation keeps BibTeX style files and `mslapa.sty' to the place your
installation keeps LaTeX style files.

If you have requests, bugs, bug fixes, or any other needs, don't hesitate to
contact me.
