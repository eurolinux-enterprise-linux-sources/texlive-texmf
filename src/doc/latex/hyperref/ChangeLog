    * New version numbering scheme of pdfTeX >= 1.30.
    * Fix for \hyper@normalise, if & is used inside \href
      in tabular environments.
    * Fix: Setting pdfproducer in \usepackage's option part
      did'nt have an effect, because it was overwritten by
      the default setting.
    * Fix: pageanchor=false disabled \@hyperfixhead and thus
      many other features unrelated to pageanchor itself.

      a. patch to  htexture.def  that adjusts the PDF@SetupDoc

    * Fix for driver pdftex: \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight
      are not set, if \paperwidth or \paperheight are zero,

    * \pdfstringdefWarn#1 prints a warning message with token #1,
      it can be used in code that disables macros by the user.
    * \pdfstringdefDisableCommands#1 is a easier interface for
      the hook \pdfstringdefPreHook. It appends its argument to the
      meaning of \pdfstringdefPreHook. The character @ can be used
      in command names.
    * \penalty is removed silently.
    * \kern and \hskip are detected with a warning:
      * At the beginning or, if the value is less than 1ex,
        they are removed.
      * Else they are replaced by a space.

    Fix for \pdfpage(s)attr:
    * Setting the /CropBox with \pdfpagesattr:
      The old meaning of \pdfpagesattr is appended.
    * Initial value of \@pdfpagestransition is \relax
      to differentiate between a unused or empty option.
    * \hyper@pagetransition (hpdftex):
      * The old entry /Trans is removed from \pdfpageattr.
      * The remaining old meaning retains and
      * the new /Trans is appended.
    * \hyper@pagetransition (pdfmark):
      * \if-switch for \relax added to get the old behaviour.

      an anchor are now processing inside {\stop@hyper...} which
      hopefully makes all hyper commands no-ops. ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk

      *something* (ie a \cite inside a \caption gave the destination of
      the cite to the caption)
    * Daniel T. Cobra <cobra@gyron.acate.com.br> gave me a new
      incompatibility with ps2pdf
