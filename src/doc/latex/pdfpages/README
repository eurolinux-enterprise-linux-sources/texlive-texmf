
The pdfpages Package
--------------------

This package simplifies the insertion of external multi-page PDF
documents into LaTeX documents. Pages can be freely selected and
similar to psnup it is possible to put several logical pages onto
each sheet of paper. Furthermore a lot of hypertext features like
hyperlinks and article threads are provided. This package supports
pdfTeX (pdflatex) and VTeX. With VTeX it is even possible to use
this package to insert PostScript files, in addition to PDF files.


Run `latex pdfpages.ins' to produce pdfpages.sty and the
driver files pppdftex.def, ppvtex.def and ppnull.def.
Move these files into a directory searched by LaTeX.

Run `latex pdfpages.dtx' to produce the documentation.

Run `pdflatex pdf-ex.tex', `pdflatex pdf-hyp.tex',
and `pdflatex pdf-toc.tex' to produce some examples.
