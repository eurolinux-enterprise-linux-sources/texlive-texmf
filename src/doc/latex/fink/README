** Version 1.1
--------------
*** Fixed missing 3rd arg to \PackageError call from \finkextension.


* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:

- Run LaTeX on the file `fink.ins' to create the style file `fink.sty'.
- Run LaTeX on the file `fink.dtx' to create the doc   file `fink.dvi'.
- Install these files anywhere you see fink^H^H^H^Hfit.

	If you're an AUC-TeX user, you can also install the file `fink.el' in
a suitable AUC-TeX style directory.


	Have fun!
