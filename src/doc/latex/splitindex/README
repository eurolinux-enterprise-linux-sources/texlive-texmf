Welcome to SplitIndex, the TeX index splitter. SplitIndex creates
multiple index files from one raw index. See manifest.txt if you want
to know the files SplitIndex exists of.

There are a lot of alternatives in using SplitIndex, because I wanted
solutions at every platform. Not all of the programs are distributed
in binary form. But splitindex.tex will work at every platform. And you
need only TeX (even not LaTeX) to run it.

Currently I support binaries for the following platforms:

	  Linux ELF i386, OpenBSD 3.0 i386, CygWIN Windows 32 Bit i386

If you need support, you can write me a mail. Use

   To: splitindex <komascript(at)gmx.info>
   Subject: SPLITINDEX: <YourProblem>

And replace <YourProblem> by a short (at least 60 chars) description
of your problem.


See file install.txt for a description how to install this
distribution and how to get the manual, which describes how to use
SplitIndex.
