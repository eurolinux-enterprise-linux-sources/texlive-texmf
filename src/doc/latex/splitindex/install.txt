	SplitIndex Installation Guide

		   2003/01/15


INTRODUCTION
============

If you know how to install LaTeX packages and how to install binary
programs, just do it. If you don't know, read the following. If you
are using Linux-i386 or OpenBSD-i386 or another Unix like environment
with installed Gnu fileutils and installed Gnu-C-Compiler, you may try
install.sh for installation. See

    ./install.sh --help

for more information. If you don't have GCC, Linux-i386 or
OpenBSD-i386 you may also use install.sh, but you have to compile
and link splitindex.c before. See the splitidx manual for this.

But you may also try the following step by step installation:


HOW TO GENERATE THE splitidx PACKAGE
====================================

1st) process splitidx.ins with TeX or LaTeX, e.g. using the following
input at a command shell (e.g. bash or command.com):

	latex splitidx.ins

Maybe you'll be asked, if you want to overwrite existing files. Answer
this question with yes.

2nd) have a look where your LaTeX Distribution searchs for
files. With teTeX you can ask kpathsea for this, e.g. using a unix
shell:

	kpsexpand \$TEXMFLOCAL

to use the local texmf tree or:

	kpsexpand \$HOMETEXMF

to use your private texmf tree. Following uses "TEXMF" to be a synonym
for the texmf tree you want to use.

3rd) create folder TEXMF/tex/latex/misc (at Windows:
TEXMF\tex\latex\misc), if it doesn't exist. Copy splitidx.sty to this
folder.

4th) call the program, which is used to update the filename data
base, e.g. texhash or mktexlsr if you are using teTeX/TeX Live.


HOW TO INSTALL THE BINARIES
===========================

5th) Rename the suitable binary (e.g. splitindex-Linux-i386, if you're
using Linux-i386) to splitindex or compile splitindex.c to generate
a binary named splitindex.

6th) copy splitindex.java to the binary search path of SUN JAVA
1.4.1.

7th) copy splitindex.pl and splitindex or splitindex.exe somewhere to
your binary search path (ask environment variable PATH).

8th) copy the manual page splitindex.1 to your manual seach path.

9th) copy splitindex.tex to the same location you've copied
splitidx.sty to and do 4th step again.


HOW TO GENERATE THE MANUAL
==========================

10th) process splitidx.dtx with LaTeX to generate the user manual of
splitidx and SplitIndex, e.g. using the following input at a command
shell:

	latex splitidx.dtx
	latex splitidx.dtx
	mkindex splitidx
	latex splitidx.dtx

or (if you do not have the mkindex script):

	latex splitidx.dtx
	latex splitidx.dtx
	makeindex -s gind.ist splitidx
	makeindex -s gglo.ist -o splitidx.gls splitidx.glo
	latex splitidx.dtx

You may print the resulting splitidx.dvi. If you prefere PDF files,
use pdflatex instead of latex.

11th) read the manual you produced at 10th step.


HOW TO TEST YOUR INSTALLATION
=============================

Use the following LaTeX source to test the installation. See
splitidx.dvi or splitidx.pdf to see how to do this.

\documentclass{article} %  We use \Class{article} class ...
\usepackage{splitidx} % ... and the \Package{splitidx} package
\makeindex %  And we want index generation
\usepackage{hyperref}
%  We define 4 indices:
\newindex[General Index]{idx} %  Name and shortcut of the 1st index
\newindex[Index of Animals]{ani} %  ... 2nd index
\newindex[Index of Fruits]{fru} %  ... 3rd index
\newindex[Index of Vegetables]{veg} % ... \dots\ 4th index

\begin{document}
Apples\sindex[fru]{apple} %  an entry to fru index
and oranges\sindex[fru]{orange} %  an entry to fru index
are fruits\sindex{fruits}. %  an implicite entry to idx index
Tomatos\sindex[veg]{tomato} %  an entry to veg index
are vegetables\index{vegetables}. %  an implicite entry to idx index
Cats\sindex[ani]{cat} %  an entry to ani index
are animals\sindex[idx]{animals}. %  an explicite entry to idx index

\twocolumn[%
 \section*{Indices}%
 \markboth{Indices}{Indices}%
]
\printsubindex* %  print all indices
\end{document}
