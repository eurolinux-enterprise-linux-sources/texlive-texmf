The _supported_ moreverb package...  supported in the sense that I'll
try and get things mended.

This is a further iteration of moreverb, following my original port to
2e and a bug mend (or two?) by David Carlisle.

This version has been pruned somewhat, from its 2.09 original, to take
account of changes to the facilities offered by the LaTeX team members
themselves.

Major changes from the original 2e port are:

 - the package no longer (re-)implements \verbatiminput (since it's
   in the verbatim package, which the package loads anyway)
 - the package no longer implements the verbatimcmd environment, and
   points you to alltt instead
 - the source is `documented'
