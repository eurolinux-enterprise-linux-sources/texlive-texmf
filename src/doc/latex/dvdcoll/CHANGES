2006/10/25  Bugfix env Dvd [jk]
              solving the indent problems within the environment Dvd
			  Indent (SPACE(s) in this case) in new line after using commands within env Dvd
			  Solution: (1) manual adding of % at the end of the commands by the user 
			            not useful, therefore
			            (2) insert \endlinechar=-1 in env Dvd
						    see: Msg-ID: <ehnv22$i4h$1@news.BelWue.DE> by Heiko Oberdiek
                            -> empty line is needed between two Dvds
