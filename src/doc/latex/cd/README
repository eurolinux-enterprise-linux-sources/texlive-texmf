A LaTeX CD cover class

This class grew out of my frustration with software for CD covers. My list of
requirements includes eternal durability of covers (I do not want to throw
away my precious covers because of an upgrade), easy batch printing with crop
marks, full typographical control, extended foreign language support, fully
open text-based format for easy copy-and-modify operations, and so on.

As usual, the package is provided by means of a .dtx source that a .ins
driver will convert into a class (.cls) file. Of course, compiling the .dtx
source will generate the documentation. For your convenience, the full
archive contains the class file and the documentation.

Normal usage requires creating a simple data file for each cover, much as in
the following example:

\covertext{
The Artist\\
\bfseries The Title
}

\leftspine{THE ARTIST}
\centerspine{THE TITLE}

\lefttracklist{
\track Song 1
\track Song 2
\track Song 3
}

\leftinfo{Words and Music by The Artist}

Then, by using the provided driver files you can easily generate one or more
covers. Note that the class uses heavily the rotating package, so you must
convert the resulting dvi file into PostScript®, or use directly pdflatex.
