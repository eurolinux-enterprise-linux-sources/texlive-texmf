Tabular column heads and multilined cells.

      Package offers a command, based on one-column tabular environment,
      which allows to support  a common layout  for tabular column heads
      in whole document.      Another offered command is for creation of 
      multilined tabular cells.    There are also:     1) a macro, which
      changes vertical spaces around all cells in tabular, like in tabls
      package,  but based  on macros of array package;     2) macros for
      multirow cells/heads, which use macro from multirow package.
