There are several \TeX\ macro packages already available, so why  is one
more necessary?  Basically I felt that there was a need  for a simple,
flexible package that added a minimum amount  to {\tt PLAIN.TEX}, and yet
still provided useful features for writing technical reports.  

Ver\TeX\ will help you to {\bf V}isualize {\bf E}conomics {\bf R}eports
using \TeX.  Ver\TeX\ will produce nice looking preprints and will aid in
formatting your bibliography, but it will also produce simulated journal
styles for a variety of economics journals.  It is very easy to add new
journal styles to Ver\TeX for someone who knows a little bit of \TeX.

\section Ver\TeX\ Commands

The easiest way to show you Ver\TeX's commands is to show you the
start of this paper.  It looks like something like this:

There are several \TeX\ macro packages already available, so why  is
one more necessary?  Basically I felt that there was a need  for a
simple, flexible package that added a minimum amount  to {\tt
PLAIN.TEX}, and yet still provided useful features for writing
technical reports./

\bigskip

That's pretty simple, isn't it?  The only extra feature that you need to
know is that you can put \verbatim/\cr/ into the \verbatim/\title/ macro if
you want to split the title into two or more lines, as in
 $$\verbatim/\title{A very, very, very, very \cr very long title}/$$

If there are two authors of a paper, use the commands
 $$\verbatim/\authortwo{The Name}\affiltwo{The University}/$$
The \verbatim/\thanks/ should come {\it before\/} the \verbatim/\author/
and \verbatim/\title/ keywords, if the style you are using attaches the
thanks as a footnote to the author or title.

What if there are more than two authors?  In that case you are on your
own, except in the preprint style.  There you can do something like:

\verbatim/\author{A. Winken \cr {\it MIT} \cr B. Blinken \cr 
  {\it University of California} \cr {\rm and} \cr C. Nod \cr 
  {\it University of Michigan}}/

This will set the authors and affiliations up the way you want them.
Be sure to leave the \verbatim/\affil/ box out if you do this trick.
I intend to provide better support for multi-authored papers in the
next release of Ver\TeX.

When you want to start a new section, you type
 $$\verbatim/\section title of the section \par/$$
and when you want to start a subsection you type
 $$\verbatim/\subsection title of the subsection \par/$$
Ver\TeX\ will handle the section numbers for you, automatically numbering
each section as required.  

You can enter footnotes by using the construction  
  $$\verbatim/\fnote{This is a footnote}/$$ and you get a
footnote.\fnote{Like this!}  If at the end of your document, you type
\verbatim/\PrintEndNotes/, \TeX\ will print out an end page with all your
footnotes on it, for those journals who just have to have it.  

If you want the paper to be double spaced, put \verbatim#\doublespace#
between \verbatim#\endtopmatter# and \verbatim#\document#.  This way the
cover will come out single spaced and the document will come out double
spaced, which is what people usually want.

If you are in doublespace mode and want to put a paragraph in single
spaced mode for some reason, type \verbatim#\singlespace#.  The document
will now revert to single spaced mode until you enter \verbatim#\doublespace#
again.

One common reason to want to use single spacing in a doublespaced document
is for long quotes.  Ver\TeX\ provides this via the command
\verbatim/\quote/, as in \verbatim/\quote{Four score and seven $\ldots$}/.

\section Extra Goodies for Math and Figures

But there are more goodies in Ver\TeX.  For example, you can attach {\it
names\/} to equations, and have \TeX\ automatically number (and renumber!)
them for you.  To use this feature you type something like the following
when you first introduce an equation:
 $$\verbatim/$$e=mc^2\eqno\Equation\Einstein$$/$$
and then when you want to reference it, you say 
 $$\ldots\verbatim/as in equation (\Einstein)./$$
The same sort of thing works with figures.  When you first reference a
figure, called, say \verbatim/\MonaLisa/, you type
\verbatim/\Fig\MonaLisa/.  \TeX\ will assign the next figure number to it
and enter ``Figure 2'' (or whatever) in the text.  At the end of the
paragraph, or roughly where you want the figure to appear, you
type 
 $$\verbatim/\Figure\MonaLisa{2in}{The great painting Mona Lisa.}/$$
The three arguments to the \verbatim/\Figure/ macro are: (1) the
figure name, (2) the vertical size of the figure, and (3) the 
caption for the figure.  \TeX\ will insert the figure using the
\verbatim/\midinsert/ command, so it will appear on the page you
ask for it if there is room, and otherwise float to the top of the
next page.

There are couple of things about equation and figure names that are worth 
pointing out.  First, \TeX\ does not allow you to use {\it numbers\/} as
part of a name.  Thus names like \verbatim/\Eq1/ and \verbatim/\Eq2/ are
not allowed. However, you can {\it reuse\/} names as often as you wish. 
You can refer to an equation as \verbatim/\A/ in one section of the paper
and later on redefine \verbatim/\A/ to refer to another equation.  I find
it  convenient to use rather long descriptive names like
\verbatim/\FirstOrderCondition/ for equations that I refer to throughout the
paper and use short names like \verbatim/\A/ for equations that I only
refer to once or twice.

There a couple of handy math commands.  You can type \verbatim/\text{for all}/ 
if you want ``for all'' to appear in math mode.  You can type
\verbatim/\D{f(x)}{x_i}/ to get 
 $$\D{f(x)}{x_i}$$ and
\verbatim/d{f(x)}{x_i}/ to get $\d{f(x)}{x_i}$. 

The command \verbatim/\proof/ sets a nice {\it Proof.}   The command
\verbatim/\qed/ gives you a box: \qed  The command \verbatim/\proclaim/
works the same as described in {\it The \TeX book}, but the style has been
changed slightly.

The command  \verbatim/\today/ gives today's date nicely spelled out, like:
\today.

To get verbatim \TeX\ listings, use the construction 
 
 $$\verbatim/\verbatim#This will appear verbatim#/$$

Any convenient symbols can be used as a delimiter in place of the
\verbatim/#/ signs.

\section References

Ver\TeX\ has nice way to deal with references.  You type something 
like the following:

\verbatim/

\ref \by{Afriat, S.} \paper{The Construction of a Utility Function from 
Expenditure Data} \jour{International Economic Review} \vol{8}
\yr{1967} \pages{67--77}\endref

\ref \by{Afriat, S.} \paper{On the Constructability of Consistent Price 
Indices Between Several Periods Simultaneously} \inbook{Essays in 
the Theory and Measurement of Consumer Behavior in Honor of Sir 
Richard Stone}\editor{A. Deaton} \publ{Cambridge University Press} 
\publaddr{Cambridge, England}\yr{1984}\endref

\ref \by{Browning, M.}\paper{A Non-Parametric Test of the Life-Cycle 
Rational Expectations Hypothesis} \paperinfo{Princeton University 
Discussion Paper 64} \yr{1984}\endref

\ref \by{Varian, H.} \paper{Nonparametric Test of Models of Consumer 
Behavior}\jour{Review of Economic Studies} \vol{50} \yr{1982b} \no{3}
\pages{99--110}\endref

\ref \by{Varian, H.} \book{Microeconomic Analysis} \publ{W.
W. Norton \& Co.} \publaddr{New York} \yr{1984}\endref
/
\medskip

and you will get a nice typeset output like:

\bigskip

Expenditure Data} \jour{International Economic Review} \vol{8} 
\yr{1967} \pages{67--77}\endref

The reference macros are quite complicated and are still being fixed; use
them at your own risk.  Currently if you omit a field that is
require---like leaving out the page numbers or something like
that---Ver\TeX\ will sometimes print out excess commas and other
punctuation.  Eventually this will be fixed, but for now it is better to
put in a dummy value, like \verbatim#\pages{???}# or something like that.

If you have a fancy reference that doesn't fit one of the above models,
just use the \verbatim#\ref# macro to start the reference.  You'll get
the right hanging indentation and inter-reference spacing that way.

Refer to the file \verbatim#vertex.hst# for the history of revisions to
Ver\TeX.  If you add some peachy macros of your own, I strongly suggest
that you put them in a separate file.  Then as new revisions of Ver\TeX\
come out, you won't have to modify them in any way.

Ver\TeX\ is in the public domain; please feel free to distribute it however
you want, as long as you indicate the original author.

\section Journals

Want to get published quick?  Then use Ver\TeX's journal simulation
feature.  Instead of using the command \verbatim\input ppt.sty\ use
the style files:

\medskip

\verbatim\jpe.sty\ --- for the {\it Journal of Polemical Economy}.

\verbatim\jep.sty\ --- for the {\it Journal of Economic Perspectives}.

\verbatim\jet.sty\ --- for the {\it Journal of Economic Theorems}.

\verbatim\aer.sty\ --- for the {\it Armenian Economic Review}.

\verbatim\ecnmet.sty\ --- for {\it Economagica}.

\verbatim\restud.sty\ --- for {\it Review for Economic Students}.

\verbatim\qje.sty\ --- for the {\it Quartered Journal of Economics}.

\medskip

When you use one of these styles, Ver\TeX\ will automatically adjust the
style of the document and the style of the references to be more-or-less
consistent with the journal style.  Some fine tuning may be needed, but 
the output generally looks pretty good.

If you want to see a small sample of each output, \TeX\ the file {\tt
vertest.tex}.
