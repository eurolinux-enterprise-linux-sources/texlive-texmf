Changes from version 2.0 (released 2003/03/03 at vntex.sf.net):
===============================================================

  * New test files with (hopefully) more meaningful names and also some
    explanation in doc/generic/vntex/tests/README.

  * Changed locations of enc/map files to conform to TDS 1.1: they now
    belong to fonts/{enc,map}/{dvips,pdftex}/vntex.  This
    may break a few things, but it must be done now, as TDS 1.1 is used
    by all recent TeX distributions

  * Added some font samples to doc/generic/vntex/tests (see README
    for more details).

  * added support for tex4ht. (Now part of the tex4ht distribution)

  * a few files had been removed:

      - dvips/vntex/config.vnr: inconsistency with urwvn, where no
        config.urwvn was available.

      - special.map: the line for vnr fonts has been added to the
        official version of special.map distributed by tetex and
        texlive.

      - tcx files: they are part of the standard TeX distributions now.

  * dblaccnt.sty and dblaccnt.tex are no longer used; they are
    retained for backwards compatibility only -- dblaccnt.sty now
    works with LaTeX 2003/12/01.

  * vntex now supports utf8 (native LaTeX) as well as utf8x (ucs.sty).
    Support for ucs.sty is a separate package now.

  * Added support for mscore fonts (tfm/vf/fd/map/enc); this requires
    a very recent version of pdftex (1.21a).

  * All human readable files contain copyright notes now.

  * Vietnamese fonts for tex4ht are now part of the tex4ht distribution

  * plainenc.tex removed from VnTeX

  * plnfss removed from VnTeX

  * ucs removed from VnTeX

  * The primary site of vntex is now http://vntex.org .  The former URL
    http://vntex.sourceforge.net or http://vntex.sf.net is still usable.

  * The urwvn fonts had been significantly improved.  The faked small caps 
    in URW Palatino had been replaced by real small caps designed by Ralf
    Stubner.  Vietnamese accents had been provided by Han The Thanh.
    Oldstyle numbers are not supported yet.

  * Vietnamese characters had been added to Bitsream Charter fonts.

  * VnURWChanceryL-MediItal added.
