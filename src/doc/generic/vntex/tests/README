This directory contains some TeX files to test the functionality
of vntex, as well as to create vietnamese font samples.


Makefile
========
There is a Makefile which can be used to compile the test files and
font samples.  Usage information is provided in the Makefile
itself.  You have to edit the top of the file for customization.
If it doesn't work for you, instructions are given below how you can
compile the test files manually.


Test Files
==========
test-vietnam.tex:       test of Vietnamese support in LaTeX using
                        vietnam.sty and inputenc

test-vietnam-tcx.tex:   test of Vietnamese support in LaTeX using
                        vietnam.sty and TCX

test-babel.tex:         test of Vietnamese support in LaTeX using
                        babel and inputenc

test-plain.tex:         test of Vietnamese in plain using plainenc

test-plain-tcx.tex:     test of Vietnamese in plain using TCX


What is tcx?
------------ 
  TCX is an extension that allows translation of input encoding. The 
  advantage over using inputenc is that it allows vietnamese text in
  logging messages instead of TeX's hexadecimal representation (^^ab).

  The disadvantage is that it is not portable (TCX is web2c-specific),
  it allows only one input encoding in a single document and utf8 is 
  not supported. If you don't mind those carets in logging messages,
  simply use inputenc.

  It is impossible to use utf8 with plain; to do so an extension
  called enctex by Petr Olsak is required. However so far nobody
  ever asked for plain TeX support.

-------------------------------------------------------------
If tcx is not supported by your system, just ignore the files
  test-vietnam-tcx.tex
and
  test-plain-tcx.tex
-------------------------------------------------------------

There are also some other files that are included by the
above test files:

test-accents.tex:       test of accent commands
test-captions.tex:      test of Vietnamese captions
test-tcvn.tex:          test of TCVN input encoding
test-viscii.tex:        test of VISCII input encoding
test-utf8.tex:          test of UTF8 input encoding


To compile the test files, run:

pdflatex test-vietnam
pdflatex -parse-first-line test-vietnam-tcx
pdflatex test-babel
pdftex test-plain
pdftex -parse-first-line test-plain-tcx

(or use tex/latex instead of pdftex/pdflatex)

Run latex/pdflatex twice to get a table of cotents.


Font samples
============
All font sample files require vnsample.sty.

vnr-test.tex:            quick test of vnr fonts
vnr-sample.tex:          sample of vnr fonts

t5lm-test.tex:           quick test of lmodern fonts
t5lm-sample.tex:         sample of lmodern fonts

urwvn-test.tex:          quick test of urwvn fonts
urwvn-sample.tex:        sample of urwvn fonts

chartervn-test.tex	 quick test of charter fonts
chartervn-sample.tex     sample of charter fonts

t5antt-test.tex:         quick test of antt fonts
t5antt-sample.tex:       sample of antt fonts

t5iwona-test.tex         quick test of iwona fonts
t5iwona-sample.tex       sample of iwona fonts

t5kurier-test.tex        quick test of kurier fonts
t5kurier-sample.tex      sample of kurier fonts

mscore-test.tex:         quick test of mscore fonts
mscore-sample.tex:       sample of mscore fonts


These sample files use LaTeX, and require certain packages
to compile.  To compile these font samples, of course, the
corresponding font package must be installed as well. 

If you do not have all the required files installed, you can
download the samples as PDF files from

   http://vntex.org/fontsamples

Run pdflatex twice to get bookmarks.  Some of the sample files 
are very large and bookmarks will be helpful.

Some of the sample files require a vast amount of memory.
If you have a web2c based system (look whether you have 
a file `texmf.cnf' somewhere), you have to set the environment
variable 

  font_mem_size=1200000

Linux, UNIX, Mac OS X:
----------------------
  Either set it in the current shell:

    font_mem_size=1200000; export font_mem_size
    pdflatex vnrsample.tex

  or for a single process:

    env font_mem_size=1200000 pdflatex vnrsample.tex
    
Windows:
--------
    set font_mem_size=1200000
    pdflatex vnrsample.tex

MikTeX:
-------
    Edit the file MIKTEX.INI.  Look for a line beginning with
    "font_mem_size=" and set the value to at least 1200000.
    
Systems not based on web2c:
---------------------------
    Read the manual of your TeX system to find out how to 
    increase font_mem_size.  If it is not explained in the
    manual, maybe memory is allocated dynamically and you
    don't have to do anything. In this case, just try

    pdflatex vnrsample.tex
    
----------------------------------------------------------
Please note that you do not have to increase font_mem_size
to use vntex, the huge amount of memory is needed for the 
font samples only.
