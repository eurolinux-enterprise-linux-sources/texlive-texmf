This bundle currently consists of the following files:
    bghyphen.tex 
    bghyphsi.tex 
    catmik.tex 
    mik2t2.tex

To install for babel:
   1) Copy the files bghyphen.tex bghyphsi.tex catmik.tex mik2t2.tex
        to, say, c:\texmf\tex\generic\hyphen\

   2) Create formats for LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, etc. 
      instructing babel to use bghyphen.tex 
          (In MikTeX, goto MikTeX Options->Languages, 
                      edit/add the entry for the Bulgarian language, 
                      specify  bghyphen.tex   as the hyphenation file,
                      Regenerate the desired formats, LaTeX, PdfLaTeX, etc.)

   3) Then the Bulgarian hyphenation rules will be used 
         whenever you select Bulgarian language in your document.
