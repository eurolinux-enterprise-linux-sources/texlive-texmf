Currently, for each driver file of the CB font family there is a corresponding
Type 1 font, which implies that  PS/PDF files become too large when these
fonts are included. In addition, these fonts were created using a wrong
encoding vector and so the ToUnicode feature of PDF viewers does not 
work properly when dealing with PDF files created with these fonts. To
overcome these problems, it was more than necessary to write down a proper
encoding vector and, consequently, to regenerate the basic CB fonts (i.e., 
only the xxxx1000 fonts were generated). Clearly, this option makes things
a little bit difficult for people willing to write Greek since the old
font definition files expect various font sizes and not just one. Fortunately,
this problem disappears when the package type1ec is used. More specifically,
the following command should appear just after the \documentclass command:

\usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}

Certainly, there are plans to update the various font definition files, but 
this will happen when the new (virtual) x7 fonts will be ready.
