	This document describes how to get GreekTeX up and running
	on your system. It is devided into two parts: instructions
	for Unix users and Instructions for DOS emTeX users. I would
	like to hope that these two categories represent a majority
	of TeX users and I apologize for not extending specialised
	instructions to users of other systems. For those of you that do
	not fall in the two categories do not panic! Read the DOS
	section and procede with the same steps. Just change the
	paths and executables to match the ones in your system.
	

Part A: 	Unix Users
--------------------------

	What you need: 
		To rebuild the whole GreekTeX package you need to have
		access to the metafont and initex programs as well
		as the ability to integrate new fonts and formats
		to the search path of the local tex distribution.
		You also need the gftopk utility for transforming
		mf output to dvi readable form. For automated installation
		you need a "standard" unix 'make' program, and the
		'dc' calculator. If you do not have any of these you
		will have to do the job by hand. If you do not have
		the dc calculator you can still build the fonts
		by altering the script to suit your own needs.
		You also need to know the resolution of the local
		printer. Finally you can do with a bit of patience.

	Procedure:
		The installation procedure follows the steps:
			* build and install the fonts in the
			  standard path (both pk and tfm files)
			* build the greek format files for both
			  greekTeX and grlatex.
			* place the files in the appropriate 
			  directory
			* do a test run to see how it looks!

	How to procede for an automated installation:
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	STEP			DESCRIPTION
	-> 0	Find a suitable place to unpack the file
		kdgreek3.1.tar.Z. Let us call the subdirectory
		kdgreek3.1/ where all the files will be the
		TOP directory.
	-> 1	First edit the file unix/newfont. If a similar
		script exists in your system the just forget it
		and mode to the step 2. In particular set the
		default paths and executable names to point
		to the right direction and make sure the file
		has the execute attribute set.
	-> 2	Edit the Makefile at the TOP directory to 
		reflect the paths and setting of your own system.
		It should be easy and straightforward and not many
		changes should be needed in a standard distribution.
	-> 3 	Make the fonts: at the shell prompt type
			make fonts
		This will try to create the greek fonts for all
		needed magnification levels and place them at
		their proper place (all the job is done by the
		newfont script in the unix directory or the
		newfont script that you set in the makefile).
		Do not be alarmed if "stange Pos " occur at some
		fonts and magnifications. The fonts are still in
		experimental stage and do have problems. If your
		version of metafont stops at a '?' prompt just
		hit return to continue.
	-> 4	You can now build the formats. give the command
			make formats
		this will build both greek.fmt and lgreek.fmt in
		the build subdirectory. Log files will be in the
		log subiderctory of build.
	-> 5 	Install everything in its proper place by 
		executing the command:
			make install
		This will place everything in the proper place
		and have you ready to go.
	-> 6 	Try the system out: go to the doc doc subdir
		and type 
			greektex usage
		then see what happens.
	

Part B: 	DOS emTeX users
-------------------------------

	What you need:
		In order to use GreekTeX on a PC running DOS and emTeX
		you will need mf and friends to create the fonts (mfjob
		for automated procedures) plain tex and latex bearing
		version 3.0 or later (that is the format file not the
		executable). 

	How to procede:
		Unpack the distribution where convenient. If you got
		GreekTeX as greektex.zip the use [pk]unzip -d greektex
		at an apropriate directory. You can delete the unix,
		utils directories and the makefile since they are
		intended for unix users. 

	-> 1	Copy the file emtex/kdgreek.mfj to the MFJOB path or
		in the mf directory. cd to the mf directory and
		give the command mfjob -i kdgreek. If everything goes
		well you will end up with a new bunch of fonts in
		the proper directories.
	-> 2	cd to tex and type
			tex -i -8 greek \dump
		This will create the files greek.fmt and greek.log
		Move greek.fmt to the directory where you normally 
		store the format files (e.g. emtex/btexfmts) and 
		delete the file greek.log after reviewing the messages.
	-> 3	cd to latex and type
			tex -i -8 lgreek \dump
		Repeat the same procedure as in step 2 for copying the
		lgreek.fmt and removing the lgreek.log file.
	-> 4	copy the files in the tex, latex directories to the
		default search path of emtex (e.g. /emtex/inputs)
		If you will be using a greek ISO character set for
		modern greek you might also want to copy the files
		emtex/greek.* to your inputs dir.
	->5	Finally move the emtex/*.bat files to the emtex bin
		directory and you are all set to go.
	->6	Test the system by cd to doc and doing
			greektex usage.tex
		
	GOOD LUCK

Please send comments and bug reports to kd@doc.ic.ac.uk

DISCLAIMER: 
	Although I have put much effort in eliminating bugs, the
	greekTeX package is still in experimental phase. If you 
	decide to use the package please do not blame me for any
	problems that may arise from its use. I cannot be held
	responsible for any problems and I cannot gurantee 
	bug fixes (although I guarantee that in due time I will
	look over all reports and suggestions).
