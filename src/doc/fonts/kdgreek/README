What it is:
	GreekTeX is a complete package for typesetting greek
	(modern or ancient) texts within the framework of 
	plain TeX or LaTeX. It supplies a set of fonts based
	on the excellent ones originally developed by
	Sylvio Levi in the States and the modifications made
	thereafter by Haralambous in France. 
	The approach adopted is different from both the
	previous ones since it uses full 256 character fonts 
	and ligatures as the principal method of accenting
	or "breathing" letters. This makes the macros more
	robust and easier to use within TeX and LaTeX 
	environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Two different packages are included in this distribution. (Both
      based on the same set of fonts).
	* greektex : an extension of plain tex 
	* grlatex  : an extension of LaTeX for greek texts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

What it Includes:
	> a complete set of fonts (regular,bold,italic)
	> for working with plain tex a file to be included
	  which will import the macros and fonts needed
	  to add greek texts within your normal documents
	  (greektex.tex)
	> for working with an extension of plain tex 
	  a set of macros allowing the usage of greek
	  within specific environments and hyphenation
	  patterns for the greek langugage. Choosing
	  to use this option will mean that you will develop
	  the formatting of your text by yourself.
	  (command greektex)
	> for working with  LaTeX a style option that allows
	  entering greek text within specific environments
	  (all standard latex command still work e.g. font
	  size changing). For typesetting texts mainly in
	  greek a new format file which combines the greek
	  enviroment with hyphenation patters and an optional
	  global greek mode.
	  (command grlatex)
	> A set of utilities that allow the conversion of extended
	  ASCII greek ISO character files to a format understandable
	  by grektex and grlatex. (filter as C-source or emTeX filter
	  table for use with texconv)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Differnces from the Previous release
	* Fixed font bugs in ligatures and added some more characters
	  according to suggestions by J"org Knappen  (J"org, thanks for 
	  your comments and fixes)
	* Integrated Unix and Dos Release
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Note:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	If you are building the greek extension of the LaTeX format
note that the old font coding scheme is used. The package -although it
will create a proper Format file- will not run properly under the 
Mittelbach convention for font loading. In order to check
which on you have see your lfonts.tex file! (To make sure that
you do not have to retrieve the standard lfonts.tex I have included in
the latex directory -- please note the copyright notices for this file).


Hope you enjoy the package. Please send any comments or bug reports
to kd@doc.ic.ac.uk
