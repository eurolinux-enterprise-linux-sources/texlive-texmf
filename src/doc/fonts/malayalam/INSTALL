Malayalam-TeX installation guide


Malayalam-TeX has been installed and tested on MS-DOS with emTeX, Atari-ST with
CSTeX and various on UNIX machines. A Macintosh version (OzTeX) is forthcoming.

The installation procedures differs on all these machines, so look under the heading
of your machine.

Included are .PK files intended for use with a CanonCX laserprinter engine (which is the
engine most 300 DPI laser printers use) If you need different fonts, you will have
to generate the fonts yourself using METAFONT.

Atari-ST with CSTeX (presuming you use the command line shell gulam)

To install
  1. Unpack the archive.
  2. Place the *.tfm files in a directory where TeX can find them
  3. Place the *.pk files in the directories where the DVI previewer and DVI printer
	 driver can find them.
  4. Place the mm.ttp, patc.ttp and the gulam batch files (ending with .G)
	 in a directory your shell can find them (normally C:\bin\)
  5. Set the environment variable MMDIR to the path where mm.trs, mm.scr, etc. are. 
  	 (mmfont\preproc in the distribution) 
	 Everything should be in working order now
To create the .pk fonts
  1. Start C_MF
  2. Edit the file MM.FTS to include the fonts and magnifications you need
  3. Set the input directory to the directory where the Malayalam Metafont sources are
  4. Select the output device
  5. Create the fonts. (This may take some time)
	 C_MF will automatically place the resulting .PK files in the correct directories.


MS-DOS with emTeX

To install
  1. Unpack the archive
  2. Place the *.TFM files in a directory where TeX can find them
  3. Place the *.PK files in the directories where the DVI previewer and DVI printer
	 driver can find them.
  4. Place the PATCH.EXE, MM.EXE and the batch files (ending with .BAT)
	 in a directory your path points at (normally C:\DOS\)
  5. Set the environment variable MMDIR to the path where MM.TRS, MM.SCR, etc. are.
  	 (MMFONT\PREPROC in the distribution) 
	 Everything should be in working order now
To create the *.PK fonts
  1. Edit the file MM.JOB to select the files and device you need
  2. Run MFJOB with this file.


UNIX

To install
  1. Unpack the archive. (It may be required to change all names to lowercase
  	 if this is not done automatically)
  2. Place the *.tfm files in a directory where TeX can find them. (or tell
     TeX where they are by setting the environment variable TEXFONTS)
  3. Place the *.pk fonts in a directory your previewer and printer driver can
     find them. (or tell TeX where they are by setting the environment variable 
	 TEXPKS) For some TeX implementations, it may be required to rename the
	 fonts from *.pk to *.300pk
  6. Look in mm.c to find the line saying #define ATARI_ST, change this into
     #define UNIX
  5. Make the preprocessor and the patc program, by saying make in the directory
     they reside.
  6. Make the batch programs (ending in .g) executable, if you wish you may remove
     the .g extention. (It is only needed for gulam on the Atari)
  7. Set the environment variable MMDIR to point at the directory where
     the .scr and .trs files are  (mmfont/preproc in the distribution).
To create the *.*pk fonts
  1. run Metafont, for example to make mm10.300gf
  	 type `mf &plain "\mode=hplaser; mag:=1; input mm10"'
     replace hplaser with your favourite mode    
  2. Convert the resulting *.*gf file to a *.*pk file 
     type `gftopk mm10.gf mm10.pk'
  To make all fonts, run the batch file mm.bat. This may take some time.
To test
	type `ml mmtable.mm mmtable.tex'
	type `tex &plain mmtable'
	Print or view the resulting mmtable.dvi file.


Porting

The included source code has been successfully compiled on

* Turbo-C v2.03 for Atari ST.
* gcc v2.3.1 on HP-UX.
* Turbo C++ on MS-DOS. (use Huge memory model and word alignment options, increase 
  stack-size)

If it doesn't work right away, things you may need to do include:
* change options in the Makefile
* make a project file for Turbo C++ (the one included is for Atari)
* change the line with
    #define ATARI_ST 
  in the file mm.c to your system type.



Good luck
