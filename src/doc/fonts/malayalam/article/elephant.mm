Some men, all blind from their birth, (happening) to be together at one place, requested
earnestly of an elephant-driver to show them an elephant. He said: examine it, and be off.
It is a fine thing, said one blind man, feeling the elephant's leg; (so said) another blind
man stroking his trunk, (so said) another passing his hand over the ear, (so said) another 
thouching his tail. Having thus examined the elephant, as they went away, they began to
speak to one another of the greatness of the elephant. He that had felt the leg said the
elephant was like a mortar for poundig rice. He that felt the trunk, that it was like
a pestle or rice-beater; he that had touched the tail, that it was like a broom, and he that
had stroked the ear, that it was like a winnowing fan. Thus they went on quarrelling
without end, each declaring the contrary to the other.
