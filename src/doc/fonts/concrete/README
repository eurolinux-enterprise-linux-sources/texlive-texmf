COPYING:

All files in the subdirectory `mf' are official sources of the
Concrete Roman fonts designed by Donald E. Knuth.  They are
distributed under the terms of the file README.KNUTH which says:

  [These files] ... are master files for TeX and METAFONT,
  maintained personally by Donald E. Knuth.  Nobody else is
  authorized to make any changes whatever to them!  If you
  modify the files for any purpose, you must give your files
  a different name, so that installations of TeX throughout
  the world will be 100% compatible when they use the
  official source files.


DESCRIPTION:

This directory appears on CTAN archives as:

  CTAN:fonts/concrete

It contains two subdirectories `mf' and `tfm' that hold the
Metafont sources and font metrics of the Concrete Roman fonts.

To access the Concrete Roman fonts in plain.tex, you may wish to
consult the file `gkpmac.tex' in CTAN:systems/knuth/local/lib.

To access the Concrete Roman fonts in LaTeX(2e) in combination
with the Euler math fonts, you may wish to consult the `beton'
and `euler' packages in CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported.

To access the Concrete Roman fonts in LaTeX(2e) in combination
with the Concrete Math (concmath) fonts, you may wish to consult
the `concmath' package in CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported.

To access the Concrete Roman fonts in LaTeX(2e) in the T1/TS1
encoding as well as in the OT1 encoding, you may wish to consult
the `ccfonts' package in CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported.


INSTALLATION:

- If you have a TDS-compatible TeX installation, you may try to
  use the enclosed `Makefile' by calling:

    make install

- For manual installation, copy the contents of the subdirectories
  `mf' and `tfm' to TEXMF/fonts/{source,tfm}/public/concrete or
  wherever else your installation keeps .mf sources and .tfm files.


Happy TeXing!
