READ.ME for AMS-TeX version 2.2                             2001/08/29

AMS-TeX is a macro package that works with the TeX typesetting program.
A working TeX system is a prerequisite for using any of the components
of AMS-TeX.  [TeX is not an AMS product; see the AMS TeX Resources page
(http://www.ams.org/tex/tex-resources.html) for information if you
do not already have TeX.]

Obtain a printed copy of the full installation instructions:
 - Process amstinst.tex with Plain TeX, or
 - Print the amstinst.ps file provided.
Read the instructions; they are much more complete than the summary
provided here.

The instructions assume that your TeX system is arranged according to
the recommended TeX Directory Structure (TDS).  Check the documentation
for your TeX system to find out if it uses the TDS.  A copy of the TDS
report can be found at CTAN either as an online document
    .../tds/standard/tds
or as a printable pdf file
    .../tds/standard/tds/tds.pdf
Items on CTAN can usually be found through the CTAN Catalogue:

FILES IN THE AMS-TeX DISTRIBUTION

A complete list of the files contained in the distribution is included
in the installation instructions (amstinst).

There are two basic methods of obtaining the files needed for AMS-TeX:
 - Retrieve one of the AMS-TeX bundles from the AMS FTP server
    ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/
   or the AMS web site
    http://www.ams.org/tex/amstex.html
 - Retrieve the individual files from one of the AMS servers or from CTAN
    .../macros/amstex/
Install these files as described in the installation instructions
(amstinst); a summary appears below, under INSTALLING AMS-TeX.

Also, AMS-TeX will call for AMSFonts.  Check the tfm-files subdirectory
    TEXMF/fonts/tfm/ams/
to see whether it is already populated (most TeX distributions now
include the AMSFonts).  If not, retrieve the .tfm files for AMSFonts 2.2
and install them into your system tfm-files subdirectory.

These .tfm files can be retrieved in several ways:
 - as a bundle from the AMSFonts page on the AMS web site at
    http://www.ams.org/tex/amsfonts.html
 - as a tfm.tar file in the /pub/tex directory at the AMS FTP site,
    ftp://ftp.ams.org
 - as individual .tfm files from the /pub/tex/amsfonts/tfm subdirectory
   at the AMS FTP site or from CTAN in .../fonts/amsfonts/tfm
(Note: set the file type to binary in FTP when transferring .tfm files.)
Even if you do not use any symbols from the AMSFonts, you will need at
least the .tfm files to use amsppt.sty and to TeX the accompanying
documentation for AMS-TeX.

The following documentation files will be useful in installing and using
AMS-TeX.

amstinst.tex -  Installation instructions, comprising Appendices B and C
amstinst.ps     of amsguide, provided as both TeX source and ready-to-print
                PostScript.
amsguide.tex -  The AMS-TeX User's Guide, provided as both TeX source and
amsguide.ps     a ready-to-print PostScript file.  When you have completed
                the installation of AMS-TeX 2.2, process the .tex file using
                AMS-TeX 2.2 and print the resulting .dvi file.  The output
                will be a brief guide to using AMS-TeX 2.2, supplementing
                The Joy of TeX.
joyerr.tex   -  The TeX input file for a document listing errata to
                The Joy of TeX prior to AMS-TeX 2.0. It also should be
                run through TeX using AMS-TeX 2.2.
joyerr2.tex  -  The TeX input file for a document listing errata to the
                second edition of The Joy of TeX, for AMS-TeX 2.1 and up.
                Process with AMS-TeX 2.2 as for the other .tex files.
amsppt.doc   -  Technical documentation for amsppt.sty, including an update
                history.
amsppt.faq   -  Frequently asked questions and answers regarding AMS-TeX
                and amsppt.sty.


INSTALLING AMS-TeX 2.2 ON YOUR SYSTEM -- A BRIEF OVERVIEW

Backup any existing AMS-TeX files before installing a new release.

Read the instructions in amstinst; they are more complete than these notes.

If you have retrieved a bundled distribution and unbundled it with the
appropriate tool, the files will be placed into the following subdirectories:

    TEXMF/doc/ams/amstex
    TEXMF/source/amstex
    TEXMF/tex/amstex/base
    TEXMF/tex/plain/amsfonts

If you have retrieved individual files, you will need to place them into
subdirectories as described in amstinst.ps.

AMS-TeX will call for the AMSFonts 2.2 .tfm files.  Check for their
presence on your system and, if necessary, retrieve them and place them
in the proper location as described above.

Remember that most TDS sytems operate using a filename list or database,
which must be updated when new files are added; consult your TeX system
documentation for update instructions.

Run amstex.ini through INITEX (the version of TeX which has no format
preloaded, distributed with your implementation of TeX). It will produce
a format file which will function as a preloaded version of AMS-TeX.
Place this format file in the directory where your implementation of
TeX looks for format files (see your system documentation), refresh the
filename database, and you are ready to use AMS-TeX 2.2.

If you habitually use the AMSPPT documentstyle, you may prefer to
include it in the format file you create. This can be done by editing
the file amstex.ini, using any text editor, and uncommenting the line
that reads "\documentstyle{amsppt}".  Before creating the format file,
read Appendix C from the installation instructions.

We recommend that, as a first test of your installation, you run the
file amsguide.tex through TeX, and print out the output. This will
provide further information about using AMS-TeX.

========================================================================
Highlights of the differences between versions 2.1 and 2.2:

AMSTEX.TEX
----------

---Removed copyright notice and restriction from message printed on
   terminal and in log for every run.

AMSPPT.STY
----------
(See the user's guide (amsguide.tex) and amsppt.doc, section 20, for
full details.)

---\subjclass was updated to use \subjclassyear as the date for the
Mathematics Subject Classification scheme. (NOTE: THIS CHANGE IS NOT
BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  EXISTING DOCUMENT FILES NEED NOT BE MODIFIED BUT
THE OUTPUT WILL BE DIFFERENT IF CLASSIFICATION WAS OLDER THAN 1991.)

========================================================================
Highlights of the differences between versions 2.0 and 2.1:

AMSTEX.TEX
----------
---Improvements to the mechanisms for loading various fonts in
the AMSFonts package. For example, \loadeusm now defines a
\eusm command that can be used like \roman or \bold.

---Revamped \printoptions command.

---Some internal cleanup to reduce memory usage in some of TeX's
memory categories (notably hash size).

---Informational messages appear on screen identifying the
modules within amstex.tex during the creation of a format file.

AMSPPT.STY
----------
(See the user's guide (amsguide.tex) and amsppt.doc, sections 18 and 19,
for full details.)

---\curraddr was added, for giving the current address of an author,
if different from the address given in \address.

---\rom was added, for preventing unwanted italicization of certain
things, such as parentheses or numbers, in theorems and other italic
passages.  \rom automatically inserts italic corrections.

---The implementation of \nofrills was completely changed, to provide
better error messages for a missing or misspelled \endkeywords or
similar end command when reading a delimited argument.

---Multiple \thanks commands in the top matter will now produce
multiple acknowledgment footnotes instead of discarding all but the
last one.

---A period is no longer added automatically at the end of a
\thanks. (NOTE: THIS CHANGE IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE---DOCUMENT
FILES WILL HAVE TO BE MODIFIED.)

---\subjclassyear was added to specify the year of the Mathematics
Subject Classification scheme.  Only 1991 and 2000 are recognized,
defaulting to 1991 to maintain some backward compatibility.

---\widestnumber\item now works as claimed in the User's Guide.

---The missing \par in the internal command \penaltyandskip@ was added.

---Additional checks were added for runaway \proclaim, \definition,
\ref, \roster, etc.  The internal macro \runaway@ was changed to make
its usage more consistent and robust; in the process its name was
changed to \add@missing (and as the name suggests, it now tries to
recover by adding the missing \end... command).

---As with amstex.tex, informational messages were added identifying the
modules within amsppt.sty.

---The bibliography macros were substantially modified to correct
another longstanding bug: line breaks after explicit hyphens,
mathbins, and mathrels were inhibited. This also involved changing the
\ref-specific version of \nofrills.  BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY (WITH
VERSION 2.0) IS NOT COMPLETE WITH RESPECT TO \nofrills IN THE
BIBLIOGRAPHY MACROS.  \nofrills NOW SHOULD ALWAYS FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE NAME OF THE FIELD TO WHICH IT APPLIES, E.G., \transl\nofrills,
OR \paper\nofrills. This is more consistent with the usage of \nofrills
outside of the references section. \nofrills will cause all the "frills",
such as the parentheses around years in journal article citations, or
words like "eds." or "vol." that are supplied automatically, to be
omitted for the given field.  In addition, it will suppress the
automatic punctuation at the end of the field, if any.

---A \refstyle command was added to allow users to specify one of the
three different reference styles most commonly used in AMS publications:
letter labels in square brackets; unnumbered; and numbered (denoted A,
B, and C, respectively). The syntax is "\refstyle{A}" (immediately after
the \documentstyle command). Style C, numbered with arabic numerals, is
the default selected by amsppt.sty.  The \refstyle command ensures 
proper correspondence between the formatting of cites in the main text 
and the formatting of the references section. Also, \key can now be used
for all reference labels, and the \no command is redundant (though still
supported, for backward compatibility).

---\miscnote was added, and used in the implementation of \toappear,
so that \toappear and \finalinfo would not be mutually exclusive.
\miscnote might also be used for things like "preprint" or
"submitted".  Unlike \finalinfo, \miscnote automatically adds
parentheses.

---\procinfo was added, to give place and date where the meeting
took place, for a proceedings volume reference.

---\eds or \ed information will now be used in place of an author's
name, if \by is absent.  This would be for collections or proceedings
volumes that are cited as a whole, instead of citing a single paper
within the volume.

AMSTEX.INI
----------
File to make format file creation more convenient. See the
user's guide and/or installation notes above.

AMSPPT1.TEX
-----------
Compatibility file to allow processing of AMS-TeX 1.1 and earlier
documents under AMS-TeX 2.0+. See the user's guide.


(NOTE:  Author packages for use with AMS-TeX are available from the AMS
web site at http://www.ams.org/tex/author-info.html, or by FTP from
ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/author-info/packages.  All packages are compatible
with AMS-TeX 2.2.  If you have previously received an AMS-TeX author
package for use with an earlier version of AMS-TeX, for best results you
should retrieve an upgraded copy from the AMS server.)
