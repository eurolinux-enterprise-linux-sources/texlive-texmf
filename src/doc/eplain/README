(This file is public domain.)

This file describes the Eplain (expanded or extended plain, take your
pick) distribution.  The current version number is at the beginning and
end of eplain.tex, among other places.

See INSTALL for installation and basic usage hints.

eplain.tex is the macros.  This file is generated (by the Unix shell
script merge) from xeplain.tex, btxmac.tex, arrow.tex, and other files.
Unless you are hacking the macros, you should have no need to regenerate
the file; just use the one that's provided.  If you do regenerate it,
you will need a date program which understands the %B format (GNU date does).

doc/eplain.texi and other .texi files in the doc directory describe the
features currently provided.  If you think of additional features that
would be useful, or extensions to existing ones, see email below.

doc/eplain.info is the Info file resulting from doc/eplain.texi and
other .texi files in the doc directory, which GNU Emacs and GNU Info
can read.  You'll need makeinfo, from the GNU Texinfo distribution, to
process it, if you happen to need to.  Here is the line I added to the
dir file, in the top-level Emacs info directory:
        * Eplain: (eplain).     Expansions to plain TeX.
See http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo for more information about Texinfo.

The files in the test subdirectory are of course for testing of various
features, but also provide some examples of usage.

The util subdirectory contains some useful scripts to help with "see"
and "see also" index entries, and making index entries with
hyperlinks.

You can get the current development sources for Eplain via CVS from
sarovar, http://sarovar.org/projects/eplain.

Most of these macros, like most of the manual, are in the public domain.
The exceptions are the commutative diagram macros (the file arrow.tex)
and the documentation for them (the file doc/arrow.texi).  Both of
arrow.tex and doc/arrow.texi are under the GNU General Public
License (see the file headers for details).

Eplain was developed as part of the book TeX for the Impatient,
published by Addison-Wesley in 1990.  It is now freely available, from
http://tug.org/ftp/tex/impatient, with a free French translation.

Eplain is currently maintained by Oleg Katsitadze.
