Eplain was originally written mostly by Karl Berry.  Some ideas were
suggested by Paul Abrahams, who also wrote a few of the macros.  Other
macros are based on ones in The TeXbook.

David Guichard and Adam Lewenberg improved the multicolumn macros.
Stepan Kasal has contributed several patches.
Oleg Katsitadze added the hyperlink capabilities to Eplain.
Oren Patashnik has worked tirelessly on improving the BibTeX macros.
Heiko Oberdiek wrote ifpdf.sty and pdfcrop.pl.
Steven Smith wrote the commutative diagram macros.
Philip Taylor wrote path.sty starting from an initial macro by Nelson Beebe.
Nelson also collected the texnames.sty which Eplain incorporates.
