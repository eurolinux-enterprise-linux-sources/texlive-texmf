How about list processing macros like those in ``Tex in Practice''? 

In TUGboat volume 11 number 3, Amy Hendrickson gives some modified
routines for \newcount that do work inside groups.  Perhaps they should
be included.

FABROADI@CUGSBVM.BITNET suggests that the verbatim macros be extended to
allow things like:
    \verbatim{first line
    second line 
    third line}
to optionally have line numbers.

Generalize toc files to other kinds of generated listings (e.g., figures).

Define a spec for \ifempty and write a robust macro to implement it.
