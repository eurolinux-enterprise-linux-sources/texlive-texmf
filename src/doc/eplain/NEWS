3.1 (3 December 2006)

General:
* Rearranged the distro to comply with TDS.
* Distro now includes PDF, HTML and INFO versions of the manual.
* Removed etex.tex.

LaTeX packages under Eplain:
* When reloading LaTeX packages, warn and skip reloading, instead of
  giving an error.  Suggested by Dan Luecking.
* The primitive \input is now restored after loading LaTeX packages.
* Added more "LaTeX" defs needed by:  the `draft' option to
  graphic{s,x}.sty; warnings from epstopdf.sty when graphics.sty is
  not loaded.

Hyperlinks:
* Added the `hypertex' driver, and made it the default driver.
* Made footnote hyperlinks off by default.
* Added the \href macro.  Suggested by Dorai Sitaram.
* LABEL argument of the hyperlink macros now allow special characters
  like # and ~ (useful for URLs).  Suggested by Dorai Sitaram.
* Fixed a hyperlink-related bug in equation macros.
* Fixed a bug in the `nolinks' driver.
* Added \writenumberedtocline macro, which is \writenumberedtocentry
  with permuted parameters.  Suggested by Dorai Sitaram.
* Hyperlink macros now ignore leading spaces in option lists.
* All hyperlink macros now report errors until links are enabled.

Cross-references, TOC and indexing:
* Added warnings about multiply defined xref labels.  Suggested by
  Tomas Penicka.
* Fixed \definexref to (once again) ignore following spaces.
* Indexing macros now read TERM, SUBTERM and SEE... arguments
  verbatim, to allow special characters and catcode changes.
  Suggested by Dorai Sitaram.
* Extended the TOC macros:  when given an integer for the type of a
  TOC entry, they write \tocentry{NUM}... to the .toc file.  Suggested
  by Dorai Sitaram.

Programming defs:
* Added \ifinteger and \isinteger macros.
* Added \For loop which strips off leading spaces from items.

Manual:

  (empty) line of the file.


3.0 (20 September 2005)
* Eplain now hosted at Sarovar: http://sarovar.org/projects/eplain/
* Support for hyperlinks!
* Support for (a few) LaTeX packages, notably graphicx and color.
* Incorporated ifpdf.sty into eplain.tex [2005-08-15].
* Many improvements of double-column macros by Stepan Kasal.
* ConTeXt compatibility; do not wipe out toc file unnecessarily to
  allow multiple contents. [2005-08-12].
* Avoid pagebreak at the xref \write before a list item. [2004-07-26]
* When under \indexproofing, allow hyphenation of indexed words and
  avoid shift of page body. [2004-08-31]
* New documentation for the hyperlinks and the LaTeX package support,
  many improvements of the old docs.

2.8 (2 September 2000)
* Added a section on user-defined environments to progdef.texi and
  fixed a few typos in documentation. Suggested by Paul Abrahams 
  [25 April 1999] 
* Added a fix to a buggy double-column macro that Adam Lewenberg
  introduced when attempting to fix the balancing macros. 
  [9 April 2000]

2.7 (14 January 1998)
* Added the control sequence \gutterbox as a hook to add arbitrary
  vertical material between columns in multi-column mode. [5 December 1997] 
* Removed spurious space in \verbatim macro. [26 March 1997]
* Added some code to the multiple columns section so that when
  switching from multi- to single-columns lines are not lost. 
  [22 September 1996].
* Changed \smash to \smash@@ in arrow.tex to allow arrow.tex to work with
  amstex. [2 March 1996].
* Changed all dimension values in margin setting macros to 'true'; redefined
  \magnification so that this works.

2.6 (2 May 1994)
* Indexing support (in conjunction with MakeIndex).
* Generalization of .toc files for lists of figures/tables, etc.
* \commdiag and other arrow macros work again.
* \eqalignno right-justifies the first column in \leftdisplays, as in
  non-leftdisplays.

2.5 (31 March 1994)
* Do not ignore first \ref command.
* Make \verbatim (and the || feature) work again (thanks to Dorai Sitaram).

2.4 (16 March 1994)
* \catcode of @ properly restored (reported by adam@symcom.math.uiuc.edu).
* `| ' in \verbatim argument documented (also reported by adam).
* | not hardwired as the \verbatim escape character (thanks to
  dorai@cs.rice.edu).
* Defining \noarrow before eplain.tex is read omits arrow macros
  (suggested by Rex Shudde <0024P@NAVPGS.BITNET> and
  murray@macadam.mpce.mq.edu.au.)
* Double column macros revamped (thanks to guichard@fermat.whitman.edu) so
  \singlecolumn can be invoked on the same page as \doublecolumns.
  3- and 4-column typesetting also supported.
  Column ejects also supported (sort of).
* \parskip set to zero before each footnote (but not for the footnote text).
* \ref and \cite conflicts with amstex described in manual.

2.3 (1 March 1993)

* New macros for arbitrary cross-references.
* \iterate is redefined to allow \else in loops.
* texnames.sty uses \spacefactor1000 instead of an empty hbox to handle
  \TeX at the end of a sentence.
* New macros for hooks and properties.
* \centereddisplays and \leftdisplays can be repeated, and called in any
  order.
* New macros \csn and \ece to do common expansion things.

2.2 (11 November 1992)
* New \toks register \everylist, expanded at the start of every list.
* \footnoterulewidth defined as 2in, not 2true in, thus allowing the use
  of \mag after reading eplain.tex.  The `2true in' was Knuth's, but I
  don't know why he did it.
* \obeywhitespace works inside a \vbox.
* \boxit is \long, and uses \ehrule and \evrule.
* \writenumberedtocentry expands the chapter number, so `\the
  <register>' can be used.
* \verbatim doesn't begin and end with \par, so it can be used in the
  middle of a paragraph.
* \pathafterhook added to \path in path.sty, so macros can execute
  cleanup actions.
* The \path command and friends are documented in the manual.
