%% language.dat
%%
%% This file specifies which hyphenation patterns iniTeX should load
%% while generating a format file.
%%
%%
%% This file can contain two kinds of lines:
%% 1. Lines of the form
%% <language name> <list of pattern files to load>
%% instruct iniTeX to allocate new language and load all pattern files
%% for that language.
%% 2. Lines of the form
%% =<language name>
%% say that language name specified on this line is just a synonym for
%% the language defined by previous line.
%% Comments start with percent character.
%%
%% Note: the first defined language will be the default if you use no
%% language switching package (such as babel or polski.sty or
%% german.sty).
%% By convention the american english patterns should be the default.
%%
%% Below you'll find many example entries which you may want to
%% activate by removing the % from line beginning.  Before activating
%% any of the lines below please check if you have appropriate
%% hyphenation patterns files or iniTeX will fail to generate the
%% format. 
%%
%% If you've got here by using some configuration program you should
%% edit this file to your taste, save it and exit the editor.  Then
%% probably your configuration program will regenerate format files to
%% put your changes into effect.
